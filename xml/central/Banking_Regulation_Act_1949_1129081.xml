 </subsection><subsection>
<number>ii</number> The essential 
    characteristic of banking is the abili­ty to receive money by way of deposit 
    from the customers and also to honour the customers’ cheque. If there is an 
    inability to do so, then the mere fact that the company has a power to grant 
    loans will not make it a ‘banking company’; Mahaluxmi Bank Ltd. v. 
    Registrar of Companies, West Bengal, AIR 1961 Cal 666.

Since the Reserve Bank 
    directs the loan transactions of the banks with their customers, they are 
    not statutory agree­ments and thus courts are not entitled to apply Act to
