The

    Schedule II
 


[See section 11(2)]
 



Principles for Determination of the Net  

    Average Annual Income
 


1. The competent authority shall first 
    determine the gross income actually derived by the holder of the vacant land 
    acquired during the period of five consecutive years referred to in clause 
    (a) of sub‑section (1) of section 11 including any income from any produce 
    derived from cultivation of the land during the said period. tc 
    "1. The competent authority shall first determine the gross income 
    actually derived by the holder of the vacant land acquired during the period 
    of five consecutive years referred to in clause (a) of sub‑section (1) of 
    section 11 including any income from any produce derived from cultivation of 
    the land during the said period." 
 


2. For such determination the competent 
    authority may— tc 
    "2. For such determination the competent authority may—" 
 


(a)   hold any local inquiry and obtain, if 
    necessary, certified copies of extracts from the property tax assessment 
    books of the municipal or other local authority concerned showing the rental 
    value of such land; tc 
    " (a) hold any local inquiry and obtain, if necessary, certified 
    copies of extracts from the property tax assessment books of the municipal 
    or other local authority concerned showing the rental value of such land;" 
 


(b)   estimate the income from any produce 
    from such land, after holding such local inquiry and taking such evidence as 
    it thinks fit and after giving an opportunity to the person concerned of 
    being heard in the matter. tc 
    " (b) estimate the income from any produce from such land, after 
    holding such local inquiry and taking such evidence as it thinks fit and 
    after giving an opportunity to the person concerned of being heard in the 
    matter." 
 


3. The net average annual income referred to 
    in clause (a) of sub‑section (1) of section 11 shall be sixty percent. of 
    the average annual gross income which shall be one‑fifth of the gross income 
    during the five consecutive years as determined by the competent authority 
    under paragraph 1.
 


4. Forty per cent. of the gross annual income 
    referred to above shall not be taken into consideration in determining the 
    net average annual income but shall be deducted in lieu of the expenditure 
    which the holder of the vacant land would normally incur for payment of any 
    tax to the municipal or other local authority and for collection and other 
    charges including cultivation charges.
