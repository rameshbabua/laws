<title>THE DELHI LAWS (SPECIAL PROVISIONS) ACT, <year>2006</year></title>

No. 22 of <year>2006</year>
[ 19th May, <year>2006</year>.]

An Act to make special provisions for the areas of Delhi for a period of one year and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.

Whereas phenomenal increase in the population owing to migration has put tremendous pressure on land and infrastructure in Delhi resulting in developments which are not in consonance with the Master Plan of Delhi <year>2001</year> and the building bye- laws;

And whereas keeping in view the perspective for the year 2021 and emerging new dimensions in urban development, the Central Government has proposed extensive modifications in the Master Plan of Delhi, which have been published and suggestions and objections have been received in respect thereof from the public, and the finalisation of the Master Plan 2021 is likely to take some more time;

And whereas the Central Government has constituted a Committee of Experts to look into the various aspects of unauthorised construction and misuse of premises and suggest a comprehensive strategy to deal with them;

And whereas a revised policy for relocation and rehabilitation of slum dwellers in Delhi is also under consideration of the Central Government;

And whereas a strategy is proposed to be prepared by the local authorities in Delhi in accordance with the National Policy for Urban Street Vendors;

And whereas action for violation of the provisions of the Master Plan, <year>2001</year> and building bye- laws, before a final view is taken in the matter by the Government, is causing avoidable hardship and irreparable loss to a large number of people;

And whereas some time is required for making orderly arrangements in terms of the proposed Master Plan 2021;

And whereas it is expedient to have a law to provide temporary relief to the people of Delhi against such action for a period of one year within which various policy issues referred to above are expected to be finalised;

Be it enacted by Parliament in the Fifty- seventh Year of the Republic of India as follows:-
