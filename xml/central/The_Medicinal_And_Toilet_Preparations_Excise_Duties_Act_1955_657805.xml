the Central Government in the Official Gazette, or which is a brand name, that 
is, a name or a registered trademark under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 
1958 (43 of 1958), or any other mark such as a symbol, monogram, label, 
signature or invented words or any writing which is used in relation to that 
medicinal preparation for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a 
connection in the course of trade between the preparation and some person having 
the right either as proprietor or otherwise to use the name or mark with or 
without any indication of the identity of that person.
 


Explanation II.—Where 
any article is chargeable to duty at a rate dependent on the value of the 
article, such value shall be deemed to be the value as determined in accordance 
with the provisions of section 4 of the Central Excise Act, 1944 (1 of 1944).
 


Explanation III.—(1) 
Notwithstanding anything contained in Explanation II, the Central Government 
may, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify any dutiable goods, in 
relation to which it is required, under the provisions of the Standards of 
Weights and Measures Act, 1976 (60 of 1976) or the rules made thereunder or 
under any other law for the time being in force, to declare on the package 
thereof the retail sale price of such goods, to which the provisions of clause 
(2) shall apply.
 


(2) Where dutiable goods 
specified under clause (1) are chargeable to duty with reference to value, then, 
notwithstanding anything contained in Explanation II, such value shall be deemed 
to be the retail price declared on such goods less such amount of abatement, if 
any, from such retail price as the Central Government may allow by notification 
in the Official Gazette.
 


(3) The Central Government 
may, for the purpose of allowing any abatement under clause (2), take into 
account the duty of excise, sales tax and other taxes, if any, payable on such 
goods.
 


(4) Where on the package of 
any dutiable goods more than one retail sale price is declared, the maximum of 
such retail sale price shall be deemed to be the retail sale price for the 
purposes of clause (2).
 


(5) Where different retail 
sale prices are declared on different packages for the sale of any dutiable 
goods in packaged form in different areas, each such retail sale price shall be 
the retail sale price for the purposes of valuation of the dutiable goods 
intended to be sold in the area to which the retail sale price relates.

Explanation, “retail sale price” means the maximum  price at which the excisable 
goods in packaged form may be sold to the ultimate consumer and includes all 
taxes local or otherwise, freight, transport charges, commission payable to
