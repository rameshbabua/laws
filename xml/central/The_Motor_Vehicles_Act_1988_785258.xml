 </subsection></section><section>
<number>3</number> Where 
    any such judgment as is referred to in sub-section (1) is obtained from a

    and, if so, at what premium and on what conditions, and the expression

Comments
 
The power of seizure is 
      nothing else than a sovereign power which is delegated to the police in 
      the discharge of their duties of law enforcement and in the enforcement of 
      an orderly society. The power of seizure, the power of arrest, are 
      sovereign powers which have to be exercised with extraordinary care and 
      caution: K. Laxmi v. Sub-Inspector of Police (Traffic-West),
