        (e) references to section 16A of the Wealth-tax Act

5[2. Quoted shares and debentures of 
companies.—The value of an equity 
share or a preference share in any company or a debenture of any company which 
is a quoted share or a quoted debenture shall be taken as the value quoted in 
respect of such share or debenture on the date on which the gift was made or 
where there is no such quotation on such date, the quotation on the date closest 
to such date and immediately preceding such date.
 

Explanation—The 
words and expressions used in this rule and rules 3 to 7 but not defined and 
defined in rule 2 of Schedule III of the Wealth-tax Act shall have the meanings 
respectively assigned to them in rule 2 of that Schedule.
 

3. Special provision for 
quoted shares of companies.—Notwithstanding 
anything in rule 2, the value of an equity share in any company which is a 
quoted share may, at the option of the assessee or a company, be taken on the 
basis of the average of the value quoted on the 31st day of March immediately 
preceding the assessment year and the values quoted in respect of such share on 
the said dates in relation to each of the immediately preceding nine assessment 
years, or where there is no such quotation on any of the aforesaid dates, the 
quotation on the date closest to the said date and immediately preceding such 
date:
 

Provided that where for any 
reason the value of such share is quoted in relation to lesser number of 
assessment years than the said nine assessment years, then the value or values 
so quoted shall be taken into account for the purposes of the aforesaid average:
 

Provided further that where 
the assessee opts for the average of the values so quoted, he shall get such 
vlaues certified by an accountant and attach the certificate to the return of 
gifts in respect of the relevant assessment year.
 

Explanation.—For 
the purposes of this rule, “accountant” shall have the same meaning as in the 
Explanation below sub-section (2) of section 288 of the Income-tax Act.

date on which the gift was made at a rate of dividend of not less than eight per 
cent., be the paid-up value of such share; and
 

        (b) where the preference share is issued before the 
said date at a rate of dividend of less than eight per cent., be the adjusted 
paid-up value of such share.
 

(2) Where no dividend has been 
paid in respect of an unquoted preference share by any company continuously for 
not less than three accounting years ending on the date on which the gift was 
made or, in a case where the accounting year of the company does not end on that 
date, for not less than three continuous accounting years ending on a date 
immediately before the date on which the gift was made, the paid-up value or, as 
the case may be, the adjusted paid-up value shall be reduced—
 

        (a) in the case of a non-cumulative preference 
share, as indicated in the Table below:—
 


 


Table
 


Number of accounting years 
ending on the date on which         Rate of reduction  

the gifts was made or, in a case where the accounting year

ending on a date immediately preceding the date on which  

the gift was made, for which no dividend has been paid
 


 



  (1)

Four 
years                                       20%          of the paid-up value or 
the
 


Five 
years                                       30%          adjusted paid-up value, 
as 
 

Six years 
and above                         40%          the case may be.
 


 


 
 

        (b) in the case of cumulative preference share, by 
one-half of the rates specified in the aforesaid Table.
 

Explanation—For 
the purposes of this rule, “adjusted paid-up value”, in relation to a preference 
share, means an amoount which bears to the paid-up value of the preference share 
the same proportion as the stipulated rate of dividend [being the rate of

and in a case where such dividend is required to be increases under the 
provisions of section 3 of the Preference Shares (Regulation of Dividends) Act, 
1960 (63 of 1960), the rate of dividend as so increased] on such share bears to 
the rate of eight per cent.
 

5. Unquoted equiry shares 
in companies other than investment companies.—(1) 
The value of an unquoted equity share in any company, other than an investment 
company, shall be determined in the manner set out in sub-rule (2).
 

(2) The value of all the 
liabilities as shown in the balance-sheet of such company shall be deducted from 
the value of all its assets shown in that balance-sheet; the net amount so 
arrived at shall be divided by the total amount of its paid-up equity share 
capital as shown in the balance-sheet; the result multiplied by the paid-up 
value of each equity share shall be the break up value of each unquoted equity 
share, and an amount equal to eighty per cent. of the break-up value so 
determined shall be the value of the unquoted equity share for the purposes of 
this Act.
 

(3) For the purposes of 
sub-rule (2),—
 

        (a) the following amounts shown as assets in the 
balance-sheet shall not be treated as assets, namely:—
 

              (i)     any amount paid as advance tax under 
the Income-tax Act;
 

             (ii)     any amount shown in the balance-sheet 
including the debit balance of the profit and loss account or the profit and 
loss appropriation account which does not represent the value of any asset;
 

        (b) the following amounts shown as liabilities in 
the balance-sheet shall not to be treated as liabilities, namely:—

in accordance with the law applicable thereto;
 

            (vi)     any amount representing contingent 
liabilities other than arrears of dividends payable in respect of cumulative 
preference shares.
 

Explanation.—For 
the purposes of this rule “balance-sheet”, in relation to any company, means the 
balance-sheet of such company (including the Notes annexed thereto and forming 
part of the accounts) as drawn up on the date on which the gift was made and, 
where there is no such balance-sheet, the balance-sheet drawn up on a date 
immediately preceding that date, and, in the absence of both, the balance-sheet 
drawn up on a date immediately after the date on which the gift was made.
 

6. Unquoted equity shares 
in investment companies.—(1) Subject 
to rule 7, the value of an unquoted equity share in an investment company shall 
be determined in the manner specified in sub-rule (2).
 

(2) The value of all the 
liabilities as shown in the balance-sheet of such company shall be deducted from 
the value of all its assets shown in that balance-sheet; the net amount so 
arrived at shall be divided by the total paid-up equity share capital of the 
company as shown in the balance sheet, and the result multiplied by the paid-up 
value of each equity share shall be the value of the unquoted equity share in 
that investment company for the purposes of this Act. 
 

(3) For the purposes of 
sub-rule (2), the value of an asset disclosed in the balance-sheet of the 
company shall be taken to be its value determined in accordance with the rules 
as applicable to that particular asset and, in the absence of any such rule, the 
value of such asset shall be its value as deter-mined under rule 20 of Schedule 
III of the Wealth-tax Act.
 

(4) For the purposes of this 
rule,—
 

        (a)  “balance-sheet” has the same meaining as in

facilitating the valuation of unquoted equity shares under this rule and rule 7,

the auditors relating to such valuation in the prescribed form shall be 
furnished to the Assessing Officer and the shareholders of the company; and the 
valuation made by the auditors shall be taken into account in the assessment of 
the shareholder of the company.
 

7. Unquoted equity shares 
in interlocked companies.—(1) The 
value of an unquoted equity share in one of the two interlocked companies held 
by the other interlocked company for the purposes of rule 6 shall be equal to 
the paid-up value of such share or the value determined under sub-rule (2), 
whichever is higher.
 

(2) For the purpose of 
sub-rule (1), the aggregate value of all the equity shares in an interlocked 
company shall be arrived at by multiplying the maintainable profits of such 
company by—
 

        (a) the fraction 100/8.5 in a case where the gross 
total income of the company consists, to the extent of not less than 51 per cent
