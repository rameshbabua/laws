    inscriptions or other like objects ought not to be moved from the place

 </section><section>
<number>2</number> A

 <subsection>
<number>a</number>   exempt such 
      property from the said notification;
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>b</number>   purchase such 
      property, if it be moveable, as its market-value; or

Where the ancient statues situated in the 
      campus were directed to be removed by the District Magistrate to an 
      ancient Museum on the basis of a notification made under section 18, the 
      order was wholly without jurisdiction. Section 18 is intended to impose a 
      restriction that either an owner or any other person authorised in law to 
      move such statues shall not do so without a written permission of the 
      collector. Thus the section has a negative impact and is restrictive of 
      the unfettered power which the owner or other competent person on his 
      behalf would have otherwise enjoyed of dealing with such object; Ashok
