Comments
 
Once there is want of 
      jurisdiction the availability of material for the finding as to 
      relationship is of little purpose. The decision rendered is vitiated due 
      to want of jurisdiction and has to be set aside. A right judgment by a 
      wrong Court is no judgment in the eye of law; Sudamabai v. 
      Pratap Singh, AIR 1989 MP 117.

Comments
 
It is settled principle of law that 
no party shall be made to suffer because of a wrong order passed by any Court. 
It is because of an order passed by the Court accepting the security that a 
party did not deposit any further amount. Interest of justice, consequently, 
requries that in such a case where a contrary view is taken at a subsequent 
stage by the same Court. Court is obliged to give an opportunity to the party to 
comply with the provisions of section 17 of the Act before rejecting the 
application for setting aside the ex-parte decree for non-compliance of 
the provisions of section 17; Mohan Lal v. Additional District Judge,
