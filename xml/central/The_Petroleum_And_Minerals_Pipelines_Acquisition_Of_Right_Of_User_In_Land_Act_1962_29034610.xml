COMMENTARY
 

Government can appoint its employee to assess compensation: Supreme Court.—The 
Supreme Court held that a petroleum or mineral corporation can appoint its own 
employee as the authority for deciding the compensation to be given to the 
property taken over by it.
 

Overruling the judgment of the Bombay High Court that an officer of the 
corporation cannot be appointed because he may be biased in favour of the 
corporation by reason of his employment, the Supreme Court said that there was 
nothing in the law which prevents an employee from becoming the competent 
authority for acquisition,
 


 
A 
three‑Judge bench consisting of Justice S. Ranganathan, Justice N. M. Kasliwal 
and Justice S.C. Agarwal declared this in the case of Hindustan Petroleum 
Corporation Ltd. which took steps to lay down pipeline for a project called the 
Bombay Pune pipeline project.
 


 
Under 
the Petroleum and Minerals Pipeline (Acquisition of Right of User in Land) Act, 
the Government appointed Mrs. A.R. Gadre, Special Land Officer in the 
corporation as the authority for acquisition and assessment of compensation. One 
person whose property was acquired for the pipeline challenged her appointment 
on the ground that she was an employee of the corporation and therefore biased 
against him.
 


 
The 
High Court allowed the petition and directed the Government to appoint another 
person who is not an employee as the authority. Against this the Central 
Government appealed to the Supreme Court, but it was dismissed as it was filed 
too late. The corporation also appealed, but its appeal was dismissed on legal 
grounds.
 


 
The 
judgment explained that the law did not bar the appointment of an employee. 
Moreover, the person appointed makes several expert decisions apart from 
deciding the compensation. He has to verify land revenue records, issue 
notification and decide all disputes. “Thus such person becomes a better 
qualified and experienced person equipped with a proper background to decide the 
amount of compensation also,” the judgment said.
 


 
If 
the argument was taken to its logical conclusion “the result would be that no 
employee of the state or Central Government will be appointed as competent 
authority where petroleum and minerals pipelines are to be laid,” it said.
 


 

However, in this particular case, Mrs. Gadre was found to be fighting a case 
against the petitioner on some other issue. On that ground, the court held that 
Mrs. Gadre might be biased; but not because she was an employee of the 
corporation.<footcitenum>16</footcitenum>

<number>2</number> If the amount of compensation is not deposited within the time prescribed 
under sub‑section (1), the Central Government, the State Government or the
