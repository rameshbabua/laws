*<number>19</number> Grounds 
    for which a candidate other than the returned candidate may be declared to 
    have been elected.—If any person 
    who has lodged an election petition has, in addition to calling in question 
    the election of the returned candidate, claimed a declaration that he 
    himself or any other candidate has been duly elected and the Supreme Court 
    is of opinion that in fact the petitioner or such other candidate received a 
    majority of the valid votes, the Supreme Court shall, after declaring the 
    election of the returned candidate to be void, declare the petitioner or 
    such other candidate, as the case may be, to have been duly elected: 
 
Provided that 
    the petitioner or such other candidate shall not be declared to be duly 
    elected if it is proved that the election of such candidate would have been 
    void if he had been the returned candidate and a petition had been presented 
    calling in question his election.
