 </section><section>
<number>3</number> Where 
    any workers in a factory are paid on a piecerate basis, the time rate shall

    Where the State Government is satisfied that, owing to the nature of the 
    work carried on or to other circumstances, it is unreasonable to require 
    that the periods of work of any adult workers in any factory or class or 
    description of factories should be fixed beforehand, it may, by written 
    order, relax or modify the provisions of section 61 in respect of such

    or class or description of factories from any or all of the provisions of 
    sections 51, 52, 54 and 56 on the ground that the exemption is required to 
    enable the factory or factories to deal with an exceptional press of work.
