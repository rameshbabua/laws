 <title>Dominant and servient heritages and owners. </title>-The land for the beneficial  
  enjoyment of which the right exists is called the dominant heritage, and the owner or occupier thereof the dominant owner; the land on which the liability is imposed is called the servient heritage, and the owner or occupier thereof the servient owner. 
 Explanation. -In the first and second clauses of this section, the expression "land" includes also things permanently attached to the earth; the expression "beneficial enjoyment" includes also possible convenience, remote advantage, and even a mere amenity; and the expression "to do something" includes removal and appropriation by the dominant owner, for the beneficial enjoyment of the dominant heritage, of any part of the soil of the servient heritage, or anything growing or subsisting thereon.

sign which, upon careful inspection by a competent person, would be visible to 
him. 
 A non-apparent easement is one that has no such sign.

</article> 

  
 <article><title><number>15</number> Acquisition by prescription. </title>-Where the access and use 
of light or air to and for any building have been peaceably enjoyed therewith, 
as an easement, without interruption, and for twenty years, 
 and where support from one person's land, or things affixed thereto, has been 
peaceably received by another person's land subjected to artificial pressure, or 
by things affixed thereto, as an easement, without interruption, and for twenty 
years, and where a right of way or any other easement has been peaceably and 
openly enjoyed by any person claiming title thereto, as an easement and as of 
right, without interruption, and for twenty years, 
 the right to such access and use of light or air, support or other easement 
shall be absolute. 
 Each of the said periods of twenty years shall be taken to be a period ending 
within two years next before the institution of the suit wherein the claim to 
which such period relates is contested. 
 Explanation I. -Nothing is an enjoyment within the meaning of this 
section when it has been had in pursuance of an agreement with the owner or 
occupier of the property over which the right is claimed, and it is apparent 
from the agreement that such right has not been granted as an easement, or if 
granted as an easement, that it has been granted for a limited period, or 
subject to a condition on the fulfilment of which it is to cease. 
 Explanation II. -Nothing is an interruption within the meaning of 
this section unless where there is an actual cessation of the enjoyment by 
reason of an obstruction by the act of some person other than the claimant, and 
unless such obstruction is submitted to or acquiesced in for one year after the 
claimant has notice thereof and of the person making or authorizing the same to 
be made. 
 Explanation III. -Suspension of enjoyment in pursuance of a contract 
between the dominant and servient owners is not an interruption within the 
meaning of this section. 
 Explanation IV. -In the case of an easement to pollute water, the 
said period of twenty years begins when the pollution first prejudices 
perceptibly the servient heritage. 
 When the property over which a right is claimed under this section belongs to 
the 1 [Government], this section shall be read as if, for the words "twenty 
years" the words 2 ["thirty years"] were substituted. 
 Illustrations 
 <section><number>a</number> A suit is brought in 1883 for obstructing a right of way. The defendant 
admits the obstruction, but denies the right of way. The plaintiff proves that 
the right was peaceably and openly enjoyed by him, claiming title thereto, as an 
easement and as of right, without interruption, from 1st January, 1862 to 1st 
January, 1882 . The plaintiff is entitled to judgment. 
 </section><section><number>b</number> In a like suit the plaintiff shows that the right was peaceably and 
openly enjoyed by him for twenty years. The defendant proves that for a year of 
that time the plaintiff was entitled to possession of the servient heritage as 
lessee thereof and enjoyed the right as such lessee. The suit shall be 
dismissed, for the right of way has not been enjoyed "as an easement" for twenty 
years. 
 </section><section><number>c</number> In a like suit the plaintiff shows that the right was peaceably and 
openly enjoyed by him for twenty years. The defendant proves that the plaintiff 
on one occasion during the twenty years had admitted that the user was not of 
right and asked his leave to enjoy the right. The suit shall be dismissed, for 
the right of way has not been enjoyed "as of right" for twenty years. 






</section></article> 

  
 <article><title><number>16</number> Exclusion in favour of reversioner of servient heritage. 
</title>-Provided that, when any land upon, over or from which any easement has 
been enjoyed or derived has been held under or by virtue of any interest for 
life or any term of years exceeding three years from the granting thereof, the 
time of the enjoyment of such easement during the continuance of such interest 
or term shall be excluded in the computation of the said last-mentioned period 
of twenty years, in case the claim is, within three years next after the 
determination of such interest or term, resisted by the person entitled, on such 
determination, to the said land. 
 Illustration 
 A sues for a declaration that he is entitled to a right of way over 
B 's land, A proves that he has enjoyed the right for 
twenty-five years; but B shows that during ten of these years C 
had a life-interest in the land; that on C's death B became 
entitled to the land; and that within two years after C 's death he 
contested A 's claim to the right. The suit must be dismissed, as 
A, with reference to the provisions of this section, has only proved 
enjoyment for fifteen years. </article>

Explanation, or interferes materially with the physical comfort of the 
plaintiff, or prevents him from carrying on his accustomed business in the 
dominant heritage as beneficially as he had done previous to instituting the 
suit. 
 Explanation III. -Where the easement disturbed is a right to the 
free passage of air to the openings in a house, damage is substantial within the 
meaning of this section if it interferes materially with the physical comfort of 
the plaintiff, though it is not injurious to his health.

    easement is extinguished when either the dominant or the servient heritage 
    is completely destroyed. 
 
 


      Illustration
 


      A 
      has a right of way over a road running along the foot of a sea-cliff. The 
      road is washed away by a permanent encroachment of the sea. A's 
      easement is extinguished.
  
 


      COMMENTs  
 

      There is nothing in this Act to support the contention that where a right 
      to light and air to a building has been acquired, a partial destruction of 
      it extinguishes that right; F.S. Pathuck v. F.E. Davar, 7 
      Bom  LR 352.

 <article><title><number>47</number> Extinction by non-enjoyment. </title>-A continuous easement is 
extinguished when it totally ceases to be enjoyed as such for an unbroken period 
of twenty years. 
 A discontinuous easement is extinguished when, for a like period, it has not 
been enjoyed as such. 
 Such period shall be reckoned, in the case of a continuous easement, from the 
day on which its enjoyment was obstructed by the servient owner, or rendered 
impossible by the dominant owner; and, in the case of a discontinuous easement, 
from the day on which it was last enjoyed by any person as dominant owner: 
 Provided that if, in the case of a discontinuous easement, the dominant 
owner, within such period, registers, under the Indian Registration Act, 1877 (3 
of 1877)<footcitenum>8</footcitenum> , a declaration of his intention to retain such easement, 
it shall not be extinguished until a period of twenty years has elapsed from the 
date of the registration. 
 Where an easement can be legally enjoyed only at a certain place, or at 
certain times, or between certain hours, or for a particular purpose, its 
enjoyment during the said period at another place, or at other times, or between 
other hours, or for another purpose, does not prevent its extinction under this 
section. 
 The circumstance that, during the said period, no one was in possession of 
the servient heritage, or that the easement could not be enjoyed, or that a 
right accessory thereto was enjoyed, or that the dominant owner was not aware of 
its existence, or that he enjoyed it in ignorance of his right to do so, does 
not prevent its extinction under this section. 
 An easement is not extinguished under this section- 
 
 <section><number>a</number> where the cessation is in pursuance of a contract between the dominant 
  and servient owners; 
 </section><section><number>b</number> where the dominant heritage is held in co-ownership, and one of the 
  co-owners enjoys the easement within the said period; or 
 </section><section><number>c</number> where the easement is a necessary easement. </section>
 Where several heritages are respectively subject to rights of way for the 
benefit of a single heritage, and the ways are continuous, such rights shall, 
for the purposes of this section, be deemed to be a single easement. 
 Illustration 
 A has, as annexed to his house, rights of way from the high road 
thither over the heritages X and Z and the intervening 
heritage Y . Before the twenty years expire, A exercises his 
right of way over X . His rights of way over Y and Z 
are not extinguished.

    <number>48</number> Extinction of accessory right.-When 
    an easement is extinguished, the rights (if any) accessory thereto are also 
    extinguished. 
 
 


      Illustration
 


      A 
      has an easement to draw water from B's well. As  accessory thereto, 
      he has a right of way over B's land to and from the well. The 
      easement to draw water is extinguished under section 47. The right of way 
      is also extinguished.

    <number>49</number> Suspension of easement.-An 
    easement is suspended when the dominant owner becomes entitled to possession 
    of the servient heritage for a limited interest therein, or when the 
    servient owner becomes entitled to possession of the dominant heritage for a 
    limited interest therein.

    <number>50</number> Servient owner not entitled to require continuance.-The 
    servient owner has no right to require that an easement be continued; and, 
    notwithstanding the provisions of  section 26, he is not entitled to 
    compensation for damage caused to the servient heritage in consequence of 
    the extinguishment or suspension of the easement, if the dominant owner has 
    given to the servient owner such notice as will enable him, without 
    unreasonable expense, to protect the servient heritage from such damage. 
 


    Compensation for damage caused by extinguishment or suspension.-Where 
    such notice has not been given, the servient owner is entitled to 
    compensation for damage caused to the servient heritage in consequence of 
    such extinguishment or suspension. 
 
 


      Illustration
 


      A, 
      in exercise of an easement, diverts to his canal the water of B's 
      stream. The diversion continues for many years, and during that time the 
      bed of the stream partly fills up. A then abandons his easement, 
      and restores the stream to its ancient  course.  B's land is 
      consequently flooded. B sues A for compensation for the 
      damage caused by the flooding. It is proved that A gave B a 
      month's notice of his intention to abandon the easement, and that such 
      notice was sufficient to enable B, without unreasonable expense, to 
      have prevented the damage. The suit must be dismissed.

    <number>51</number> Revival of easement.-An 
    easement extinguished under section 45 revives 
<section><number>a</number> when the destroyed 
    heritage is, before twenty years have expired, restored by the deposit of 
    alluvion; (b) when the destroyed heritage is a servient building and before 
    twenty years have expired such building is rebuilt upon the same site, and 
    (c) when the destroyed heritage is a dominant  building and before twenty 
    years have expired such building is rebuilt upon the same site and in such a 
    manner as not to impose a greater burden on the servient heritage. 
 

    An easement extinguished under section 46 revives when the grant or bequest 
    by which the unity of ownership was produced is set aside by the decree of a 
    competent Court. A necessary easement extinguished under the same section 
    revives when the unity of ownership ceases from any other cause. 
 

    A suspended easement revives if the cause of suspension is removed before 
    the right is extinguished under section 47. 
 
 


      Illustration
 


      A, 
      as the absolute owner of field Y, has right of way thither over B's 
      field Z. A obtains  from B a lease of Z for twenty 
      years. The easement is suspended so long as A remains lessee of Z. 
      But when A assigns the lease to C, or surrenders it to B, 
      the right of way revives.
