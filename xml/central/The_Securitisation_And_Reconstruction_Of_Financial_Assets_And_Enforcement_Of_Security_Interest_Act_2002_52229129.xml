    this Act. 
 </section><section>
<number>2</number> Where any 
    borrower, who is under a liability to a secured creditor under a security 
    agreement, makes any default in repayment of secured debt or any instalment 
    thereof, and his account in respect of such debt is classified by the 
    secured creditor as non-performing asset, then, the secured creditor may 
    require the borrower by notice in writing to discharge in full his 
    liabilities to the secured creditor within sixty days from the date of 
    notice failing which the secured creditor shall be entitled to exercise all 
    or any of the rights under sub-section (4).

    representation or objection and if the secured creditor comes to the 
    conclusion that such representation or objection is not acceptable or 
    tenable, he shall communicate within one week of receipt of such 
    representation or objection the reasons for non‑acceptance of the 
    representation or objection to the borrower: 
 
Provided that 
    the reasons so communicated or the likely action of the secured creditor at 
    the stage of communication of reasons shall not confer any right upon the 
    borrower to prefer an application to the Debts Recovery Tribunal under 
    section 17 or the Court of District Judge under section 17A.] 
 </section><section>
<number>4</number> In case

Provided that the right to transfer by way of 
    lease, assignment or sale shall be exercised only where the substantial part 
    of the business of the borrower is held as security for the debt: 
 
Provided further that where the management of 
    whole, of the business or part of the business is severable, the secured 
    creditor shall take over the management of such business of the borrower 
    which is relatable to the security or the debt;] 
 </subsection><subsection>

<number>d</number>    require at any time by 
    notice in writing, any person who has acquired any of the secured assets 
    from the borrower and from whom any money is due or may become due to the 
    borrower, to pay the secured creditor, so much of the money as is sufficient 
    to pay the secured debt. 
 </subsection></section><section>
<number>5</number> Any 
    payment made by any person referred to in clause (d) of sub-section (4) to 
    the secured creditor shall give such person a valid discharge as if he has

 </section><section>
<number>6</number> Any 
    transfer of secured asset after taking possession thereof or take over of

    been made by the owner of such secured asset. 
 </section><section>
<number>7</number> Where any

    thereto, shall be recoverable from the borrower and the money which is 
    received by the secured creditor shall, in the absence of any contract to 
    the contrary, be held by him in trust, to be applied, firstly, in payment of 
    such costs, charges and expenses and secondly, in discharge of the dues of 
    the secured creditor and the residue of the money so received shall be paid 
    to the person entitled thereto in accordance with his rights and interests. 
 </section><section>
<number>8</number> If the 
    dues of the secured creditor together with all costs, charges and expenses 
    incurred by him are tendered to the secured creditor at any time before the 
    date fixed for sale or transfer, the secured asset shall not be sold or 
    transferred by the secured creditor, and no further step shall be taken by 
    him for transfer or sale of that secured asset.

<number>9</number> In the 
    case of financing of a financial asset by more than one secured creditors or 
    joint financing of a financial asset by secured creditors, no secured 
    creditor shall be entitled to exercise any or all of the rights conferred on
