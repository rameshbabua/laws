The
First Schedule
 


[See
section 3(g)]
 

Co-operative
Principles
 

1.
Voluntary and Open Membership.—Co-operatives are voluntary organisa-tions,
open to all persons capable of using their services and willing to accept the
responsibilities of membership, without discrimination on basis of gender,
social inequality, racial, political ideologies or religious consideration.
 

2.
Democratic Member Control.—Co-operatives are democratic organisations
controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies
and decision making. Elected representative of these co-operatives are
responsible and accountable to their members.
 

3.
Member’s Economic Participation.—Members contribute equality and control
the capital of their Co-operative democratically. At least a part of the surplus
arising out of the economic results would be the common property of the
co-operatives. The remaining surplus could be utilised benefiting the members in
proportion to their share in the Co-operative.
 

4.
Autonomy and Independence.—Co-operatives are autonomous, self-help
organisations controlled by their members. If co-operatives enter into agreement
with other organisations including Government or raise capital from external
sources, they do so on terms that ensure their democratic control by members and
maintenance of Co-operative autonomy.
 

5.
Education, Training and Information.—Co-operatives provide education and
training to their members, elected representatives and employees so that they
can contribute effectively to the development of their co-operatives. They also
make the general public, particularly young
people and leaders aware of the nature and benefits of co-operation.
 

6.
Co-operation among Co-operatives.—Co-operatives serve their members most
effectively and strengthen the co-operative movement, by working together
through available local, regional, national and international structures.
 

7.
Concern for Community.—While focusing on the needs of their members, 

co-operatives work for the sustainable development of communities through
policies accepted by their members.
