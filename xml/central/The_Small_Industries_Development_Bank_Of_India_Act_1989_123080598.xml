    manner as it thinks fit:
 
Provided 
    further that unless the Small Industries Bank intimates to the court that it 
    will not appeal against any order releasing any property from attachment or 
    rejecting the claim to enforce the liability of the surety, such order shall 
    not be given effect to, until the expiry of the period fixed under 
    sub-section (12) within which an appeal may be preferred or, if an appeal is

<number>13</number> Where 
    proceedings for liquidation in respect of an industrial concern in the 
    small-scale sector have commenced before an application is made under

    Small Industries Bank any preference over the other creditors of such
