The Central Government or the State Government may,—

Grounds of detention severable.—Where
a person has been detained in pursuance of an order of detention [whether made
before or after the commencement of the National Security (Second Amendment)
Act, 1984] under section 3 which has been made on two or more grounds, such
order of detention shall be deemed to have been made separately on each of such
grounds and accordingly— 


 <section><number>a</number>
such order shall not be deemed to be
invalid or inoperative merely because one or some of the grounds is or
are— 


 <subsection><number>i</number>
vague,
 </subsection><subsection><number>ii</number>
non-existent,
 </subsection><subsection><number>iii</number>
not relevant,
 </subsection><subsection><number>iv</number>
not connected or not proximately connected with such person, or
 </subsection><subsection><number>v</number>
invalid for any other reason whatsoever,
 and
it is not, therefore, possible to hold that the Government or officer making

the Government or officer making the order of detention shall be deemed
to have made the order of detention under the said section after being satisfied

Government or officer may— 


 <subsection><number>a</number>
make a report in writing of the fact to a Metropolitan Magistrate or a
Judicial Magistrate of the first class having jurisdiction in the place where
the said person ordinarily resides; 


 </subsection><subsection><number>b</number>
by order notified in the Official Gazette direct the said person to
appear before such officer, at such place and within such period as may be
specified in the order. 


 </subsection></section><section><number>2</number>

(1), the provisions of sections 82, 83, 84 and 85 of the Code of Criminal

property as if the detention order made against him were a warrant issued by the
Magistrate. 


 </section><section><number>3</number>
If any person fails to comply with an order issued under clause (b) of
sub-section (1) he shall, unless he proves that it was not possible for him to
comply therewith and that he had, within the period specified in the order,
informed the officer mentioned in the order of the reason which rendered
compliance therewith impossible and of his whereabouts, be punishable with
imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with
both.
