    Item (3).—The total number of man-shifts worked is the sum of the 
    number of persons at work on each shift during the month.
 




    2. Item (4).—Number of man-days lost should include days lost due to 
    injury in previous months, that is, if any accident which occurred in 
    previous months is still causing loss of time in the month under review, 
    such loss of time is also to be included in the month under review.  
 




    3. Item (5).—Calculation of man-days should be used on the 
    following:—  
 




    (a)  Man-days lost according to schedule of charges for permanent 
    disabilities as given in appendix B to IS: 3786-1966. In case of multiple 
    injury, the sum of a schedule charges shall not be taken to exceed 6000 
    man-days.
 




    (b)  If any injury is treated as a lost time injury in one month and 
    subsequently turns out to be a permanent disability, the man-days charged 
    due to the injury should be subtracted from the schedule charge for the 
    injury when permanent disability becomes known.
