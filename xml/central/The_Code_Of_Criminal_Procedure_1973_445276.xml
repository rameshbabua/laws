such facts that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating 
was, in the case, a material error.

charged with any murder but one, and had heard the inquiry before the 
Magistrate, which referred exclusively to the case of Haidar Baksh: 
The Court may infer from these facts that A was not misled, and that 
the error in the charge was immaterial.
