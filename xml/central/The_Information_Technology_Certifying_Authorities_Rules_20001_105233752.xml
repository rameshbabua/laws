 <article>
<number>3</number> The 
    manner in which information be authenticated by means of Digital Signature.—A 
    Digital Signature shall,—  
 <section>
<number>a</number>    be created and verified by cryptography 
    that concerns itself with transforming electronic record into seemingly 
    unintelligible forms and back again;   
 </section><section>
<number>b</number>    use what is known as “Public Key 
    Cryptography”, which employs an algorithm using two different but 
    mathematical related “keys” – one for creating a Digital Signature or 
    transforming data into a seemingly unintelligible form, and another key for 
    verifying a Digital Signature or returning the electronic record to original 
    form,   
 
the process termed as hash function shall be 
    used in both creating and verifying a Digital Signature. 
 
Explanation.—Computer 
    equipment and software utilizing two such keys are often termed as 
    “asymmetric cryptography”.

    Verification of Digital Signature.—The 
    verification of a Digital Signature shall be accomplished by computing a new 
    hash result of the original electronic record by means of the hash function 
    used to create a Digital Signature and by using the public key and the new 
    hash result, the verifier shall check—  
 <section>
<number>i</number>    if the Digital Signature was created 
    using the corresponding private key; and   
 </section><section>
<number>ii</number>    if the newly computed hash result 
    matches the original result which was transformed into Digital Signature 
    during the signing process. The verification software will confirm the 
    Digital Signature as verified if—   
 <subsection>
<number>a</number>    the signer’s private key was used to 
    digitally sign the electronic record, which is known to be the case if the 
    signer’s public key was used to verify the signature because the signer’s 
    public key will verify only a Digital Signature created with the signer’s 
    private key; and   
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>b</number>    the 
    electronic record was unaltered, which is known to be the case if the hash 
    result computed by the verifier is identical to the hash result extracted 
    from the Digital Signature during the verification process.

The Information Technology (Certifying 
    Authorities) Rules, 2000
 



 



 




    SCHEDULE II
 


[See
    rule 19(2)]
 




    Information Technology (IT) Security Guidelines
 



1. Introduction.—This 
    document provides guidelines for the implementation and management of 
    Information Technology Security. Due to the inherent dynamism of the 
    security requirements, this document does not provide an exact template for 
    the organizations to follow. However, appropriate suitable samples of 
    security process are provided for guidelines. It is the responsibility of 
    the organizations to develop internal processes that meet the guidelines set 
    forth in this document. 
 



    The following words used in the Information Technology Security Guidelines 
    shall be interpreted as follows:—
 



    •    shall: The guideline defined is a mandatory requirement, 
    and therefore must be complied with. 
 



    •    should: The guideline defined is a recommended 
    requirement. Non-compliance shall be documented and approved by the 
    management. Where appropriate, compensating controls shall be implemented. 
 



    •    must: The guideline defined is a mandatory requirement, 
    and therefore must be complied with. 
 



    •    may: The guideline defined is an optional requirement. The 
    implementation of this guideline is determined by the organisation’s 
    requirement. 
 



2.
Implementation of an Information Security Programme.—Successful 
    implementation of a meaningful Information Security Programme rests with the 
    support of the top management. Until and unless the senior managers of the 
    organization understand and concur with the objectives of the information 
    security programme its ultimate success is in question. 
 



    The Information Security Programme should be broken down into specific 
    stages as follows:—
 



    (a)    Adoption of a security policy; 
 



    (b)    Security risk analysis; 
 



    (c)    Development and implementation of a information 
    classification system; 
 



    (d)    Development and implementation of the security 
    standards manual; 
 



    (e)    Implementation of the management security 
    self-assessment process; 
 



    (f)    On-going security programme maintenance and enforcement; and
    
 



    (g)    Training. 
 



    The principal task of the security implementation is to define the 
    responsibilities of persons within the organization. The implementation 
    should be based on the general principle that the person who is generating 
    the information is also responsible for its security. However, in order to 
    enable him to carry out his responsibilities in this regard, proper tools, 
    and environment need to be established. 
 



    When different pieces of information at one level are integrated to form 
    higher value information, the responsibility for its security needs also 
    should go up in the hierarchy to the integrator and should require higher 
    level of authority for its access. It should be absolutely clear with 
    respect to each information as to who is its owner, its custodian, and its 
    users. It is the duty of the owner to assign the right classification to the 
    information so that the required level of security can be enforced. The 
    custodian of information is responsible for the proper implementation of 
    security guidelines and making the information available to the users on a 
    need to know basis. 
 



3.
Information Classification.—Information assets must be classified 
    according to their sensitivity and their importance to the organization. 
    Since it is unrealistic to expect managers and employees to maintain 
    absolute control over all information within the boundaries of the 
    organization, it is necessary to advise them on which types of information 
    are considered more sensitive, and how the organization would like the 
    sensitive information handled and protected. Classification, 
    declassification, labeling, storage, access, destruction and reproduction of 
    classified data and the administrative overhead this process will create 
    must be considered. Failure to maintain a balance between the value of the 
    information classified and the administrative burden the classification 
    system places on the organization will result in long-term difficulties in 
    achieving success. 
 



Confidential 
    is that classification of information of which unauthorized disclosure/use 
    could cause serious damage to the organization, e.g. strategic 
    planning documents. 
 



Restricted 
is that classification 
    of information of which unauthorized disclosure/use would not be in the best 
    interest of the organization and/or its customers, e.g. design 
    details, computer software (programmes, utilities), documentation, 
    organization personnel data, budget information. 
 



Internal 
use is that 
    classification of information that does not require any degree of protection 
    against disclosure within the company, e.g. operating procedures, 
    policies and standards inter office memorandums. 
 



Unclassified 
is that 
    classification of information that requires no protection against disclosure
    e.g. published annual reports, periodicals. 
 



    While the above classifications are appropriate for a general organization 
    view point, the following classifications may be considered:
 



Top Secret: 
It shall be applied to 
    information unauthorized disclosure of which could be expected to cause 
    exceptionally grave damage to the national security or national interest. 
    This category is reserved for Nation’s closest secrets and to be used with 
    great reserve. 
 



Secret: 
This shall be applied 
    to information unauthorized disclosure of which could be expected to cause 
    serious damage to the national security or national interest or cause 
    serious embarrassment in its functioning. This classification should be used 
    for highly important information and is the highest classification normally 
    used. 
 



Confidentiality: 
This shall be 
    applied to information unauthorized disclosure of which could be expected to 
    cause damage to the security of the organisation or could be prejudicial to 
    the interest of the organisation, or could affect the organisation in its 
    functioning. Most information will on proper analysis be classified no 
    higher than confidential. 
 



Restricted: 
This shall be applied 
    to information which is essentially meant for official use only and which 
    would not be published or communicated to anyone except for official 
    purpose. 
 



Unclassified: 
This is the 
    classification of information that requires no protection against 
    disclosure.

5.1 System 
    Administration.—(1) 
    Each organization shall designate a properly trained “System Administrator” 
    who will ensure that the protective security measures of the system are 
    functional and who will maintain its security posture. Depending upon the 
    complexity and security needs of a system or application, the System 
    Administrator may have a designated System Security Administrator who will 
    assume security responsibilities and provide physical, logical and 
    procedural safeguards for information. 
 



    (2) Organisations shall ensure that only a properly trained System Security 
    Administrator is assigned the system security responsibilities. 

 



    (3) The responsibility to create, classify, retrieve, modify, delete or 
    archive information must rest only with the System Administrator. 

 



    (4) Any password used for the system administration and operation of trusted 
    services must not be written down (in paper or electronic form) or shared 
    with any one. A system for password management should be put in place to 
    cover the eventualities such as forgotten password or changeover to another 
    person in case of System Administrator (or System Security Administrator) 
    leaving the organization. Every instance of usage of administrator’s 
    passwords must be documented. 
 



    (5) Periodic review of the access rights of all users must be performed.
    
 



    (6) The System Administrator must promptly disable access to a user’s 
    account if the user is identified as having left the Data Centre, changed 
    assignments, or is no longer requiring system access. Reactivation of the 
    user’s account must be authorized in writing by the System Administrator 
    (Digitally signed e-mail may be acceptable). 
 



    (7) The System Administrator must take steps to safeguards classified 
    information as prescribed by its owner. 
 



    (8) The System Administrator must authorize privileged access to users only 
    on a need-to-know and need-to-do basis and also only after the authorization 
    is documented. 
 



    (9) Criteria for the review of audit trails/access logs, reporting of access 
    violations and procedures to ensure timely management action/response shall 
    be established and documented. 
 



    (10) All security violations must be recorded, investigated, and periodic 
    status reports compiled for review by the management. 
 



    (11) The System Administrator together with the system support staff, shall 
    conduct a regular analysis of problems reported to and identify any 
    weaknesses in protection of the information. 
 



    (12) The System Administrator shall ensure that the data, file and Public 
    Key Infrastructure (PKI) servers are not left unmonitored while these 
    systems are powered on. 
 



    (13) The System Administrator should ensure that no generic user is enabled 
    or active on the system. 
 



5.2 Sensitive 
    Information Control.—(1) 
    Information assets shall be classified and protected according to their 
    sensitivity and criticality to the organization. 
 



    (2) Procedures in accordance with para 8.3 of these Guidelines must be in 
    place to handle the storage media, which has sensitive and classified 
    information. 
 



    (3) All sensitive information stored in any media shall bear or be assigned 
    an appropriate security classification. 
 



    (4) All sensitive material shall be stamped or labeled accordingly. 

 



    (5) Storage media (i.e. floppy diskettes, magnetic tapes, portable 
    hard disks, optical disks, etc.) containing sensitive information shall be 
    secured according to their classification. 
 



    (6) Electronic communication systems, such as router, switches, network 
    device and computers, used for transmission of sensitive information should 
    be equipped or installed with suitable security software and if necessary 
    with an encryptor or encryption software. The appropriate procedure in this 
    regard should be documented. 
 



    (7) Procedures shall be in place to ensure the secure disposal of sensitive 
    information assets on all corrupted/damaged or affected media both internal 
    (e.g. hard disk/optical disk) and external (e.g. diskette, 
    disk drive, tapes etc.) to the system. Preferably such 
    affected/corrupted/damaged media both internal and external to the system 
    shall be destroyed. 
 



5.3 Sensitive 
    Information Security.—(1) 
    Highly sensitive information assets shall be stored on secure removable 
    media and should be in an encrypted format to avoid compromise by 
    unauthorized persons. 
 



    (2) Highly sensitive information shall be classified in accordance with para 
    3. 
 



    (3) Sensitive information and data, which are stored on the fixed disk of a 
    computer shared by more than one person, must be protected by access control 
    software (e.g., password). Security packages must be installed which 
    partition or provide authorization to segregated directories/files. 

 



    (4) Removable electronic storage media must be removed from the computer and 
    properly secured at the end of the work session or workday. 

 



    (5) Removable electronic storage media containing sensitive information and 
    data must be clearly labeled and secured. 
 



    (6) Hard disks containing sensitive information and data must be securely 
    erased prior to giving the computer system to another internal or external 
    department or for maintenance. 
 



5.4 Third Party Access.—(1) 
    Access to the computer systems by other organisations shall be subjected to 
    a similar level of security protection and controls as in these Information 
    Technology security guidelines. 
 



    (2) In case the Data Centre uses the facilities of external service/facility 
    provider (outsourcer) for any of their operations, the use of external 
    service/facility providers (e.g. outsourcer) shall be evaluated in 
    light of the possible security exposures and risks involved and all such 
    agreements shall be approved by the information asset owner. The external 
    service or facility provider shall also sign non-disclosure agreements with 
    the management of the Data Centre/operational site. 
 



    (3) The external service/facility provider (e.g. outsourcer) shall 
    provide an equivalent level of security controls as required by these 
    Information Technology Security Guidelines. 
 



5.5 Prevention of 
    Computer Misuse.—(1) 
    Prevention, detection, and deterrence measures shall be implemented to 
    safeguard the security of computers and computer information from misuse. 
    The measures taken shall be properly documented and reviewed regularly.
    
 



    (2)   Each organization shall provide adequate information to all persons, 
    including management, systems developers and programmers, end-users, and 
    third party users warning them against misuse of computers. 

 



    (3) Effective measures to deal expeditiously with breaches of security shall 
    be established within each organisation. Such measures shall include:—
    
 


(i)    
    Prompt reporting of suspected breach; 
 



    (ii)    Proper investigation and assessment of the nature of 
    suspected breach; 
 



    (iii)    Secure evidence and preserve integrity of such 
    material as relates to the discovery of any breach; 
 



    (iv)    Remedial measures.

    Administrator or System Security Administrator for appropriate action to 
    prevent future occurrence. 
 



    (5) Procedure shall be set-up to establish the nature of any alleged abuse 
    and determine the subsequent action required to be taken to prevent its 
    future occurrence. Such procedures shall include:— 
 



    (i)    The role of the System Administrator, System Security 
    Administrator and management; 
 



    (ii)    Procedure for investigation; 
 



    (iii)    Areas for security review; and 
 



    (iv)    Subsequent follow-up action. 
 



6. System integrity and 
    security measures.
 



6.1 Use of Security 
    Systems or Facilities.—(1) 
    Security controls shall be installed and maintained on each computer system 
    or computer node to prevent unauthorised users from gaining entry to the 
    information system and to prevent unauthorised access to data. 

 



    (2) Any system software or resource of the computer system should only be 
    accessible after being authenticated by access control system. 

 



6.2 System Access 
    Control.—(1) 
    Access control software and system software security features shall be 
    implemented to protect resources. Management approval is required to 
    authorise issuance of user identification (ID) and resource privileges.
    
 



    (2) Access to information system resources like memory, storage devices 
    etc., sensitive utilities and data resources and programme files shall be 
    controlled and restricted based on a “need-to-use” basis with proper 
    segregation of duties. 
 



    (3) The access control software or operating system of the computer system 
    shall provide features to restrict access to the system and data resources. 
    The use of common passwords such as “administrator” or “president” or “game” 
    etc. to protect access to the system and data resources represent a security 
    exposure and shall be avoided. All passwords used must be resistant to 
    dictionary attacks. 
 



    (4) Appropriate approval for the request to access system resources shall be 
    obtained from the System Administrator. Guidelines and procedures governing 
    access authorisations shall be developed, documented and implemented. 

 



    (5) An Access Control System manual documenting the access granted to 
    different level of users shall be prepared to provide guidance to the System 
    Administrator for grant of access. 
 



    (6) Each user shall be assigned a unique user ID. Adequate user education 
    shall be provided to help users in password choice and password protection. 
    Sharing of user IDs shall not be allowed. 
 



    (7) Stored passwords shall be encrypted using internationally proven 
    encryption techniques to prevent unauthorised disclosure and modification.
    
 



    (8) Stored passwords shall be protected by access controls from unauthorised 
    disclosure and modification. 
 



    (9) Automatic time-out for terminal inactivity should be implemented. 

 



    (10) Audit trail of security-sensitive access and actions taken shall be 
    logged. 
 



    (11) All forms of audit trail shall be appropriately protected against 
    unauthorised modification or deletion. 
 



    (12) Where a second level access control is implemented through the 
    application system, password controls similar to those implemented for the 
    computer system shall be in place. 
 



    (13) Activities of all remote users shall be logged and monitored closely.
    
 



    (14) The facility to login as another user from one user’s login shall be 
    denied. However, the system should prohibit direct login as a trusted user (e.g. 
    root in Unix, administrator in Windows NT or Windows 2000). This means that 
    there must be a user account configured for the trusted administrator. The 
    system requires trusted users to change their effective username to gain 
    access to root and to re-authenticate themselves before requesting access to 
    privileged functions. 
 



    (15) The startup and shutdown procedure of the security software must be 
    automated. 
 



    (16) Sensitive Operating System files, which are more prone to hackers must 
    be protected against all known attacks using proven tools and techniques. 
    That is to say no user will be able to modify them except with the 
    permission of System Administrator. 
 



6.3 Password Management.—(1) 
    Certain minimum quality standards for password shall be enforced. The 
    quality level shall be increased progressively. The following control 
    features shall be implemented for passwords:—
 



    (i)    Minimum of eight characters without leading or trailing 
    blanks; 
 



    (ii)    Shall be different from the existing password and the 
    two previous ones; 
 



    (iii)    Shall be changed at least once every ninety days; 
    for sensitive system, password shall be changed at least once every thirty 
    days; and 
 



    (iv)    Shall not be shared, displayed or printed. 
 



    (2) Password retries shall be limited to a maximum of three attempted logons 
    after which the user ID shall then be revoked; for sensitive systems, the 
    number of password retries should be limited to a maximum of two. 

 



    (3) Passwords which are easy-to-guess (e.g. user name, birth date, 
    month, standard words etc.) should be avoided. 
 



    (4) Initial or reset passwords must be changed by the user upon first use.
    
 



    (5) Passwords shall always be encrypted in storage to prevent unauthorized 
    disclosure. 
 



    (6) All passwords used must be resistant to dictionary attacks and all known 
    password cracking algorithms. 
 



6.4 Privileged User’s 
    Management.—(1) 
    System privileges shall be granted to users only on a need-to-use basis.
