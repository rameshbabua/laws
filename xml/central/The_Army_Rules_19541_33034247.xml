<section><number>1</number> 
Where the case is adjourned for the purpose of having the evidence reduced to 
waiting, at the adjourned hearing evidence of the witnesses who were present and 
gave evidence before the commanding officer, whether against or for the accused, 
and of any other person whose evidence appears to be relevant, shall be taken 
down in writing in the presence and hearing of the accused before the commanding 
officer or such officer as he directs.
 </section><section>
<number>2</number> The accused may put in 
cross-examination such questions as he thinks fit to any witness, and the 
questions together with the answers thereto shall be added to the evidence 
recorded.
 </section><section>
<number>3</number> The evidence of each 
witness after it has been recorded as provided in the rule when taken down, 
shall be read over to him, and shall be signed by him, or if he cannot write his 
name shall be attested by his mark and witnessed as a token of the correctness 
of the evidence recorded. After all the evidence against the accused has been 
recorded, the accused will be asked: “Do you wish to make any statement? You are 
not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but whatever you say will 
be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence.” Any statement thereupon 
made by the accused shall be taken down and read to him, but he will not be 
cross-examined upon it. The accused may then call his witnesses, if he so 
desires, any witnesses as to character.
 </section><section>
<number>4</number> The evidence of the 
witnesses and the statement (if any) of the accused shall be recorded in the 
English language. If the witness of accused, as the case may be, does not 
understand the English language, the evidence or statement, as recorded, shall 
be interpreted to him in a language which he understands.
 </section><section>
<number>5</number> If a person cannot be 
compelled to attend as a witness, or if owing to the exigencies of service or 
any other grounds (including the expense and loss of time involved), the 
attendance of any witness cannot in the opinion of the officer taking the 
summary (to be certified by him in writing), be readily procured, a written 
statement of his evidence purporting to be signed by him may be read to the 
accused and included in the summary of evidence.
 </section><section>
<number>6</number> Any witness who is not 
subject to military law may be summoned to attend by order under the hand of the 
commanding officer of the accused. The summons shall be in the form provided in 
Appendix III.

by the commanding officer, who thereupon shall either—
 <subsection>
      <number>a</number>  remand the accused for trial by a 
court-martial; or
 </subsection><subsection>
      <number>b</number>  refer the case to the proper

      <number>c</number>  if he thinks it desirable, re-hear 
the case and either dismiss the charge or dispose of it summarily.
 </subsection></section><section>
<number>2</number> If the accused is 
remanded for trial by a court-martial, the commanding officer shall without 
unnecessary delay either assemble a summary court-martial (after referring to 
the officer empowered to convene a district court-martial when such reference is 
necessary) or apply to the proper military authority to convene a court-martial, 
as the case may require.

refusing confirmation of the finding or sentence unless, in the opinion of the 
confirming authority, substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred by reason 
of the disallowance of such claim.

plea of “Not Guilty”) shall be recorded on each charge.
 </section><section>
<number>2</number> If an accused person 
pleads “Guilty”, that plea shall be recorded as the finding of the court; but 
before it is recorded, the presiding officer or judge-advocate, on behalf of the 
court, shall ascertain that the accused understands the nature of the charge to 
which he has pleaded guilty and shall inform him of the general effect of that 
plea, and in particular of the meaning of the charge to which he has pleaded 
guilty, and of the difference in procedure which will be made by the plea of 
guilty, and shall advise him to withdraw that plea if it appears from the

1[(2A) Where an 
accused pleads "Guilty", such plea and the factum of compliance of sub-rule (2) 
of this rule, shall be recorded by the court in the following manner:—
 
        Before recording the plea of "Guilty" 
of the accused, the court explained to the accused the meaning of the charge (s) 
to which he had pleaded "Guilty" and ascertained that the accused had understood 
the nature of the charge (s) to which he had pleaded "Guilty". The court also 
informed the accused the general effect of the plea and the difference in 
procedure, which will be followed consequent to the said plea. The court having 
satisfied itself that the accused understands the charge (s) and the effect of 
his plea of "Guilty", accepts and records the same. The provisions of rule 52 
(2) are thus complied with.]

<number>3</number> Where an accused 
person pleads “Guilty” to the first of two or more charges laid in the

accused to plead thereto and a record to that effect shall be made upon the 
proceedings of the court.

<section><number>1</number> 
The accused, at the time of his general plea of “ Guilty” or “Not Guilty” to a

 <subsection>
      <number>a</number>  he has been previously convicted

<section><number>1</number> 
Upon the record of the plea of "Guilty”, if there are other charges in the same 
charge-sheet to which the plea is “Not Guilty”, the trial shall first proceed 
with respect to the latter charges, and after the finding on those charges, 
shall proceed with the charges on which a plea of “Guilty” has been entered, but 
if they are alternative charges, the court may either proceed with respect to 
all the charges as if the accused had not pleaded “Guilty” to any charge or may 
subject to sub-rule (2), instead of trying him, record a finding of "Guilty" 
upon any one of the alternative charges to which he has pleaded “ Guilty” and a 
finding of “Not Guilty” upon all the other alternative charges.
 </section><section>
<number>2</number> Where alternative 
charges are preferred and the accused pleads “Not Guilty” to the charge which 
alleges the more serious offence and “Guilty” to the other, the court shall try 
him as if he had pleaded “Not Guilty” to all the charges.
 </section><section>
<number>3</number> After the record of 
the plea of “Guilty” on a charge (if the trial does not proceed on any other 
charges) the court, shall receive any statement which the accused desires to 
make in reference to the charge, and shall read the summary 

1[***] of evidence, 
and annex it to the proceedings, or if there is no such summary 
1[***] shall take 
and record sufficient evidence to enable it to determine the sentence and the 
confirming officer to know all the circumstances connected with the offence. 
This evidence shall be taken in the manner provided in these rules in the case 
of plea of “Not Guilty”.
 </section><section>
<number>4</number> After evidence has 
been so taken or the summary 

1[***] of evidence 
has been read, as the case may be, the accused may make a statement in 
mitigation of punishment, and may call witnesses as to his character.
 </section><section>
<number>5</number> If from the statement 
of the accused or from the summary 

1[***] of evidence, 
or otherwise, it appears to the court that the accused did not understand the 
effect of his plea of “Guilty”, the court shall alter the record and enter a 
plea of “Not Guilty”, and proceed with the trial accordingly.
 </section><section>
<number>6</number> If a plea of “Guilty” 
is recorded and the trial proceeds with respect to other charges in the same 
charge-sheet, the proceedings under sub-rules (3) and (4) shall take place when 
the findings on the other charges in the same charge-sheet are recorded.
 </section><section>
<number>7</number> When the accused 
states anything in mitigation of punishment which in the opinion of the court 
requires to be proved, and would, if proved, affect the amount of punishment,

the trial accordingly.

is empowered by section 139 to find the accused guilty of an offence other than 
that charged, or guilty of committing an offence in circumstances involving a 
less degree of punishment, or where it could, after hearing the evidence, have

        (a)  Make himself 
acquainted with all the circumstances of the case and the testimony of the 
witnesses who gave evidence before the CO, and carefully consider whether the 
additional evidence is relevant and necessary [See Army Rule 23(1)]. Intelligent 
and patient investigation will often result in the discovery of a missing link 
in the chain of evidence, of corroborating evidence, or of evidence tending to 
exculpate the accused. It may even save an unnecessary or abortive 
court-martial.
 


        (b)  Before taking 
down the evidence—
 


              (i) Consider 
what offence or offences appear to have been committed.
 


             (ii) Consider 
the essential elements of such offence, or of each offence.
 


            (iii) Consider 
what facts and circumstances must be proved in order to establish not only the 
commission of an offence but also the commission of it by the accused, i.e.,what 
facts are relevant to the issue.
 


            (iv) Consider 
what evidence should be adduced in order to prove each material fact; in other 
words, how it is proposed to prove each of the necessary facts by admissible 
evidence. He will generally find it convenient to ascertain from each witness 
roughly what evidence that witness can give before actually taking down the 
evidence.
 


        (c)  When reducing 
the evidence of witnesses to writing—
 


              (i) Take down 
the evidence and arrange it, both in the statements of witnesses and in the 
summary, as far as possible so that events are set out in chronological order 
and the court may have a connected story to consider.
 


                      A 
statement of evidence as to facts should commence by recording the place, date 
and time (if material), to which the evidence refers.
 


             (ii) Ensure 
that only such evidence as is admissible in law is adduced; particularly 
eliminate all irrelevant and hearsay statements.
 


            (iii) Avoid 
attempting to tell the story of the crime by recording conversations at which 
the accused was not present.
 


            (iv) Ascertain 
that any document intended to be produced is legally admissible in evidence. 
Every document intended to be produced to the court must be produced by a 
witness and described and, where necessary, identified by a witness, who is able 
to do so. For example, where a document has been acknowledged as correct or 
signed by an accused, evidence must be given to show that he has acknowledged it 
or his signature must be identified.
 


                      Mark 
and number documents according to order of production.
 


             (v) Arrange 
for the preparation, production and proof of plans where necessary.
 


            (vi) Record the 
evidence of witnesses as nearly as possible in their own words and expressions. 
When evidence is not given in English, it will be interpreted and recorded in 
English.
 


           (vii) If the 
accused has to any person or at any time said anything by way of explanations or 
admission of any of the facts in issue, consider the  

circumstances in which the statement was made and if it is admissible let a 
witness be called to prove it.
 


           (viii) Remember 
that, when it is proposed to tender evidence of an admission or confession, it 
is desirable that evidence should first be adduced by the prosecution of the 
circumstances in which it was made to show that it was voluntary, though under 
the law the onus lies upon the accused of showing that a confession made by him 
was not voluntary.
 


            (ix) With 
regard to the attendance of witnesses, take advantage where desirable of the 
provisions of Army Rule 23(5). The written statements of such witness must be 
signed and certified as required by the said rule.
 


             (x) Remember 
that a civilian witness, can be compelled to attend the taking of the summary 
[Army Act, 135 and 136 and Army Rule 23(6)].
 


            (xi) At the 
close of the evidence of each witness who is not cross-examined by the accused, 
make a note that “accused declines to cross-examine” [Army Rule 23(2)].
 


           (xii) Ensure 
that the evidence of each witness is signed by the witness [Army [Rule 23(3)].
 


           (xiii) Ensure 
that the record of any statement made by the accused is prefaced           by a 
note that he was formally “cautioned” Army Rule 23(3)].
 


          (xiv) Enter at 
the end of the summary of evidence a statement that the requirements Army Rule 
23(1), (2), (3) and (4) have been complied with, and sign the summary. The place 
and date should be stated.
 


2. Evidence in special 
cases,—
 


        (a)  Where the 
charge is for deficiency of kit, unless IAFD 918 is to be produced in evidence, 
the fact that the accused has been at some time previously in possession of a 
complete kit, or of the articles alleged to be deficient, the date and place of 
discovering any subsequent deficiencies, and that none of the articles have 
since been recovered, should be included in the summary of evidence. Any 
articles recovered will be omitted from the charge.
 


        (b)  Where a 
certified true copy of a record of any Regimental book is to be produced [Army 
Act, section 142 (4)], the copy should show clearly that the record purports to 
have been signed by the CO or by the officer whose duty it was to make the 
record [Army Act, section 142(3)].
 


        (c)  Where the 
charge is for neglecting to obey a battalion or similar order, the order should 
be proved as provided in Army Act, section 142(3) or (4) [See (b) above], 
but if the order is not included in the “Regimental books” (Regulations Army, 
para 610), as for example a station or a company order or an order for sentries, 
the original order must be produced.
 


        (d)  Where IAFD-918 
is to be produced, it must be signed by the officer having the custody of the 
books from which it is complied. The original declaration of the court of 
inquiry, even if in existence, is not admissible in evidence. Nor is IAFD-918, 
unless the entry in the court-martial book (of which it is a certified copy) 
purports to have been signed by the officer in actual command of the accused’s 
corps or department, as required by Army Act, section 106.
 


        (e)  A certificate 
of surrender or apprehension under Army Act, section 142 (6) (IAFD-910) or under 
Army Act, section 142(5) should only state the fact, date and place of the 
surrender or apprehension of the absentee and the manner in which he was dressed 
and is only admissible as evidence of those facts and only in cases of desertion 
or absence without leave. The circumstances of the surrender or apprehension 
must be proved by a witness. The certificate must be signed by a police officer 
not below the rank of an officer in charge of a police station. For the 
surrender/apprehension certificate under Army Act, section 142(5), see 
Army Regulations, para. 378.
 


                  The CO of 
the deserter or absentee should forward IAFD-910 without unnecessary delay to 
the officer in charge of the police station for completion and signatures.
 


         (f)  Many cases 
depend on the identification of persons or things. Evidence should be recorded 
to show that each witness identifies the accused, and any other person or thing 
mentioned in his evidence whose identity is relevant to the charge, e.g., 
on a charge for theft, the articles, the subject of the charge, must be produced 
and identified or their absence statisfactorily accounted for.
 


              Articles 
alleged to have been damaged should be produced and identified.
 


        (g)  Where the 
charge is for any offence which has occasioned any expense, loss, damage or 
destruction for which it is expedient to award stoppages under Army Act, section 
71(1), values should be assessed and evidence taken as follows:—
 


              (i) When an 
article which has an official value has been lost or rendered unserviceable, a 
witness is required who can prove the value (inclusive of authorised 
departmental expenses) of the article at the date of loss upon a basis of its 
age and/or condition and by reference to the regulations which should be 
produced for fixing the value of the article at that age or in that condition.
 


             (ii) When the 
aricle has no official value competent evidence is required to prove the 
approximate value.
 


            (iii) When an 
article has been damaged but not rendered unserviceable, competent evidence is 
required to prove the pecuniary amount of the damage, which will be either the 
cost of repairing it, if it can be repaired, or the loss of value caused by the 
act of the accused, if it cannot be repaired, or the cost of repair plus any 
ultimate loss of value due to the act of the accused.
 


            (iv) In the 
case of absence or desertion, the deficiencies to be alleged in a charge under 
Army Act, section 54(b) are those ascertained when the soldier rejoins, not 
necessarily those found on the commencement of the absence, or by a court of 
inquiry.
 


                  Evidence 
should not be taken of the values of personal clothing and necessaries the 
property of a person subject to Army Act the value of which has not to be made 
good to the public.
 


        (h)  Where the 
charge is for misappropriation or losing by neglect money or stores, etc., the 
evidence should show—
 


              (i) The 
period during which the accused held office and was responsible for certain 
money or stores, etc.,
 


             (ii) That at 
the opening of this period the accounts, money, stores, etc., were correct;
 


            (iii)     
Receipts and expenditures of money, stores, etc., during this period;
 


            (iv) That at 
the close of this period there was a specific deficiency of money, stores, etc.,
 


              items (ii), 
(iii), (iv) must, as a rule, be proved by the production by a witness of the 
original account books, and vouchers, and evidence that they were kept or signed 
by the accused. Witnesses should then give evidence explaining the deficiency, 
which is checked with the original books, etc., and recorded.
 


         (i)  In cases of 
attempts to commit suicide, medical evidence giving an opinion on the state of 
mind of the accused at the time of the commission of the alleged offence should 
be taken.
 


         (j)  In cases of 
self-maiming the medical witness or witnesses should be asked whether the injury 
sustained by the accused will render him unfit for further service.
 


3. Where the accusation 
arises out of complaint made by an individual who has not yet identified the 
person whose conduct is complained of, the complainant, and any other alleged 
eye-witness in the same circumstances, should have an opportunity of picking out 
from a group the person against whom they are prepared to give evidence. For 
this purpose an identification parade should be held in the presence of an 
officer before the witness(es) give evidence at the summary, or otherwise see 
the accused in circumstances which may suggest that they are expected to 
recognise one particular person as the offender. At such parade a witness should 
not be permitted to see or hear anything which might induce him to take a cue 
from the behaviour of another witness. Regulations Army, para 406 refers.
 


4. If in any case two or 
more persons are suspected of complicity in an offence, and it is found 
necessary to call one of these as a witness for the prosecution against the 
other or others charged in connection with the offence, one of two courses must 
be taken either—
 


        (a)  proceedings 
against him must be abandoned and any charge therein already preferred against 
him dismissed; or 
 


        (b)  steps must be 
taken to ensure that the case against him is disposed of summarily or tried by 
court-martial, before the trial of persons concerned against whom he is to give 
evidence; and that he is, only tendered as a witness when he has already been 
acquitted or convicted.
 


In all such cases the 
circumstances and the course proposed should be fully set out in a covering 
letter to the convening officer.
 


COMMANDING OFFICERS
 


5. A CO will take care that 
an accused person is not detained in custody beyond 48 hours without the charge, 
being investigated, unless investigation is impracticable, in which case a 
report will be made to the officer to whom application to convene a GCM or DCM 
would be made (Army Act, section 102).
 


6. Before applying for the 
trial of an offender a CO should satisfy himself—
 


        (a)  That the 
accused is subject to the Army Act, and is charged with an offence which is an 
offence against that Act;
 


        (b)  That the 
offender is not exempt from trial under the provisions of Army Act, section 122;
 


        (c)  That the 
offence is not one which he should dispose of himself summarily or one which he 
should and can try by SCM (Regulations Army, para 447) without reference [Army 
Act, section 120(2)] or, if it is one of those offences, that from its gravity, 
or from the previous character of the accused, he ought not to deal with it on 
account of the inadequacy of his powers of punishment;
 


        (d)  That the 
summary of evidence is properly recorded (see paras 1 and 2 ante);
 


        (e)  That the 
evidence justifies the trial of the offender on the charge;
 


         (f)  That the 
charge is properly framed under appropriate section (see Army Rules 28 to 
30).
 


        (g)  That an 
officer has given the accused a copy of the summary (or abstract) of evidence as 
soon as practicable after he had been remanded for trial and that his rights as 
to preparing his defence and of being assigned or represented at the trial have 
been explained to him by that officer [Army Rule 33(7)].
 


7. When making application 
for the trial of the offender the CO should satisfy himself that the following 
provisions are complied with:—
 


        (a)  The 
application for trial (IAFD-937) (must be accompanied by all necessary documents 
as therein specified; and the medical officer’s certificate at the foot 
completed;
 


        (b)  The convening 
officer must be informed whether or not the accused desires to have a defending 
officer assigned to represent him at the trial;
 


        (c)  The 
information required as to officers who have investigated the case; or sat on a 
court of inquiry, must be given with great care;
 


        (d)  The 
charge-sheet must be signed by the officer in actual command of the unit to 
which the accused belongs or is attached and should state the place and date of 
signature;
 


        (e)  Sufficient 
space be left at the foot of the charge-sheet for the orders of the convening 
officer, or officer sanctioning trial under Army Act, section 120(2), to be 
entered. The place and date should be entered by the officer signing such 
orders;
 


         (f)  The section 
of the Army Act under which each charge is framed should be entered in the 
margin, opposite the charge to which it refers;
 


        (g)  When it is 
intended to prove any facts in respect of which any deduction from the pay and 
allowances (i.e., stoppages) of the accused can be awarded in consequence 
of the offence charged, those facts must be clearly shown in the particulars of 
the charge and the sum of the loss or damage it is intended to charge [see 
para 2(g) above];
 


        (h)  IAFD-905 by 
whomsoever produced, is to be signed by the officer having custody of the books 
from which it is complied; custody includes temporary custody for the purpose of 
the trial. In preparing this form, minor offences may be grouped as “ 
miscellaneous” offences of the same class as that being charged should be shown 
in a separate group.
 


8. After trial has been 
ordered the CO should satisfy himself that the following provisions are complied 
with:—
 


        (a)  The accused be 
warned for trial not less than 96 hours (24 hours where he is on active service) 
before the court assembles, must be informed by an officer of every charge on 
which he is to be tried, must be given a copy of the charge-sheet and a 
vernacular translation of the same and of the summary (or abstract) or evidence, 
and notice of the intention to call witnesses whose evidence is not contained in 
the summary (or abstract) and an abstract of their evidence, and must be 
inforomed of the ranks, names and units of the officers who are to form the 
court as well as of any waiting members (Army Rule 34).
 


        (b)  The accused 
must be informed that on his giving the names of any witnesses for the defence, 
reasonable steps will be taken to procure their attendance;
 


        (c)  The accused 
must be afforded proper opportunity for preparing his defence.
 


        (d)  The CO must 
not detail as a member of the court an officer who is ineligible or disqualified 
to serve under the provisions of Army Rule 39;
 


        (e)  The accused 
must be seen by a medical officer on the morning of each day the court is 
sitting for his trial and the medical officer’s report should be produced by the 
prosecutor to the court immediately after it opens;
 


         (f)  In a case of 
a joint trial, the accused persons should be informed of the intention to try 
them together and of their right under Army Rule 35(4) to claim separate trials 
if the nature of the charge admits of it.
 


9. After confirmation (or 
refusal thereof), the CO must see that the following provisions are complied 
with:—
 


        (a)  The 
proceedings must be promulgated as laid down in Regulations Army, para 472;
 


        (b)  The record of 
the promulgation must be entered on the proceedings in form shown on 
page........................and, if the proceedings have been confirmed, 
extracts recorded in the Regimental books;
 


        (c)  After 
promulgation the proceedings must be forwarded without delay to DJAG of the 
Command direct. Regulations Army, para. 477 refers.
 


CONVENING OFFICER
 


10. The convening officer 
should satisfy himself as regards the matters mentioned in paras 6 and 7 
(above); and in addition he will ensure:—
 


        (a)  In all cases 
for trial by GCM, and in all cases of indecency, fraud, theft (except ordinary 
theft), and civil offences; and in all other cases which present doubt or 
difficulty, that the charge-sheet and summary (or abstract) of evidence are 
submitted to the Deputy or Assistant Judge-Advocate General concerned before 
trial is ordered (see Regulations Army, para 458);
 


        (b)  That he holds 
the necessary court-martial warrant empowering him to convene the description of 
court-martial that he considers appropriate;
 


        (c)  That the court 
which he has decided to convene is properly composed in accordance with the Army 
Act: see also Army Rule 40 — any opinion of the convening officer with 
respect to the composition of the court under the said rule should be stated in 
the convening order;
 


        (d)  That no 
officer is detailed to serve on the court who is ineligible or disqualified 
under Army Rule 39;
 


                  Note.— 
In the case of theft from an officers’ mess, all the officers of that mess are 
regarded as interested, and are therefore disqualified.
 


        (e)  That 
application is made to the Deputy or Assistant Judge Advocate General concerned 
for the service of a JA when the appointment of a JA is legally required or is 
desirable (see Army Act, section 129);
 


         (f)  That the No., 
Rank, Name and unit of each officer detailed to serve are stated in the 
convening order correctly;
 


        (g)  That in trials 
by GCM and in complicated cases a prosecutor is specially selected for his 
experience and knowledge of military law;
 


        (h)  That the order 
for trial at the foot of charge-sheet is signed by him, or by an officer of his 
staff signing "for” him;
 


         (i)  That the 
convening order is signed by him, or by a staff officer authorised by custom and 
usage of the service to sign his orders or by the staff officer, as such.
 


11. Where the convening 
officer, or the senior officer, on the spot considers that military exigencies 
or the necessities of discipline render it impossible or inexpedient to observe 
any of the rules referred to in Army Rule 36, he must make on IAFD-920 a 
declaration to that effect specifying the nature of those exigencies or 
necessities.
 


12. The convening officer 
must ascertain whether the accused desires to have a defending officer assigned 
to assist him at his trial, and, if so, must endeavour to meet his wishes. 
Should no suitable officer be available, the convening officer must notify the 
Presiding Officer in writing [see Army Rule 95(2)].
 


13. The convening officer 
must send to the senior member of the court-martial the convening order and 
charge-sheet and, where no JA has been appointed with a copy of the summary (or 
abstract) of evidence. He should also send, to all the other members, copies of 
the charge-sheet and to the JA when one has been appointed, a copy each of the 
charge-sheet, convening order and summary (or abstract) of evidence Army Rule 
37(4) refers. Except in the case of joint trial of two or more persons a 
separate copy of the convening order should be supplied in respect of every 
person to be tried.
 


GENERAL
 


14.The original convening 
order must be before the court and the Presiding Officer must satisfy himself 
that the court is duly constituted according to its terms. The court must not 
make any alteration or correction in the convening order, nor, save as allowed 
by Army Rule 50(1) in the chargesheet.
 


15. In any case of doubts 
as to constitution of the court, or any other matter affecting jurisdiction of 
the court or validity of the charges the Presiding Officer should consult the 
convening officer before the court assembles, or if the court has assembled, 
before proceeding with the trial.
 


16. When, in accordance 
with Army Rule 89, the court is sworn/affirmed at one time in the presence of 
several accused persons who are to be tried separately. In succession the time 
at which the convening order is read should be recorded on page ‘A’ of each 
IAFD-906, as the time at which the trial of each of the accused commences. In 
such cases it is desirable that the time of arraignment of each such accused 
should be inserted on page ‘B’ of each IAFD-906 before the words: “The accused 
is arraigned”, etc.
 


17. The full name and 
description of the accused should be entered on the first page of the 
proceedings.
 


18. Care should be taken 
that, whenever a court of inquiry has been held, the relevant certificate (on 
the first page of the proceedings) is properly completed.
 


19. Any person addressing 
the court or examining or cross-examining a witness, should always do so 
standing.
 


20. Every witness, 
including the officer, producing IAFD-905 must be sworn or affirmed in the 
presence of the accused to whom his evidence refers; he must not be examined on 
a former oath taken in the presence of another accused person.
 


The prosecutor or other 
person producing doucuments must be sworn/affirmed. By the custom of 
court-martial, however, the accused is allowed to hand in letters and 
certificates of character purporting to be in the handwriting of absent officer 
of former employers, and unless there is reason to doubt their authenticity, 
they may be accepted.
 


21. The evidence will 
usually be taken down in narrative form. Questions and answers recorded verbatim 
will be numbered consecutively (“Q 1”, “A 1”, etc.),  throughout.
 


22. When original documents 
are not retained by the court and copies are attached to the proceedings, it 
must be stated in the proceedings that the copies have been compared with the 
originals and found to be correct. As a rule, it is preferable to attach copies 
and not original documents, to the proceedings. 
 


23. In accepting IAFs 
D-905, D-918, D-910 and certified copies or records in Regimental books, 
attention should be given to para 7(i), 2(d), (e), and (b) ante, respectively. 
Where these documents are given in evidence it is sufficient to record upon the 
proceedings the mere fact of their production without setting out the facts, 
which they purport to prove; but the record of evidence should always show that 
witness identified the accused as the person to whom the particular document 
relates.
 


24. A certified true copy 
of a record in a Regimental book (e.g. on IAFD- 918 of an entry in the 
court-martial book) is sufficient evidence thereof; it is not necessary for the 
court to compare the copy with the Regimental book.
 


25. Where the value of 
arms, ammunition, equipment or public clothing lost or damaged is proved, the 
accused if convicted should be sentenced to be put under stoppages, 
notwithstanding the fact that he may also be sentenced to be dismissed from the 
service, in case the latter part of the sentence should be remitted.
 


26. Arrears of pay and 
allowances forfeited by sentence of court-martial under Army Act, section 71(k) 
cannot be applied as compensation for loss or damage. If, therefore, loss or 
damage has been averred and proved, stoppages should be awarded, even if the 
accused is also sentenced to forfeiture of arrears, so that compensation may 
first be paid and any balance remaining over forfeited.
 


27. Included in IAFD-906 
are two sets of pages “C” and “D”— one for proceedings on a plea of “Not Guilty” 
and one for proceedings on a plea of “Guilty”. Where the pleas recorded are all 
“Not Guilty” or all “Guilty”, the set pertaining to the plea or pleas recorded 
is alone to be used, and the unused set should be removed from the proceedings.
 


When some of the pleas are 
“Not Guilty” and some “Guilty”, both sets will be used, the court proceedings 
first on the plea or pleas of “Not Guilty” up to and including the findings, and 
then on the plea or pleas of “Guilty”. It is not necessary to insert before page 
“D” a separate sheet containing the findings of the court upon the plea or pleas 
of “Not Guilty”.
 


28. Where two or more 
persons are charged and tried jointly on a charge-sheet, only one set of 
proceedings should normally be used, the relevant pages of IAFD-906 being 
adopted accordingly, and the replies of each of the accused to the questions set 
out therein being separately recorded. A separate sheet, however, should be used 
for the finding and proceeding on conviction, and for the sentence in each case.
 


29. Where trial proceeds on 
more than one charge-sheet, all printed matter on page ‘A’ and the two printed 
lines at the top of page ‘B’ should be struck out in the case of the second or 
any subsequent charge-sheet, the word “second”, “third” (or as the case may be) 
being inserted before the word “charge-sheet” on page ‘B’.
 


30. The charge-sheet is to 
be inserted in the proceedings after page “B” and marked as “B 2”. All other 
documents are to be attached at the end of the proceedings in the order of their 
production to the court.
 


31. Every document attached 
to the proceedings should be signed by a Presiding Officer (or JA) and marked 
with a reference letter, preferably not one used in IAFD- 906.
 


32. In case of a plea of 
“Guilty” the summary of evidence is to be annexed to the proceedings. In case of 
a plea of “Not Guilty”, it will be annexed if it or any part of it has been put 
in evidence at the trial. In other cases the summary will merely be enclosed 
with the proceedings when sent to the confirming officer.
 


33. All erasures of written 
or printed matter, and all interlineations and corrections should be initialled 
by the Presiding Officer or JA.

numbered consecutively or to the end of the proceedings after they have been put 
together in the order prescribed. In case of revision, the latter proceedings 
are added at the end, and the numbering of pages carried on.
 


35. Care must be taken that 
the proceedings are both signed and dated by the Presiding Officer and the JA 
(if any). Army Rule 67(2) refers.
 


DUTIES OF PROSECUTOR
 


36. For the general duties 
of a prosecutor see Army Rule 77(1). 
 


37. Duties before 
trial.—The prosecutor should have previous knowledge of the subject-matter of 
the charge or charges. For that reason the officer detailed as prosecutor must 
make it his business to acquaint himself with the circumstances, and assure 
himself that the various rules relating to procedure before trial have been 
complied with. He will, as a rule, be the officer who recorded the summary of 
evidence. The court will look to him for an explanation of any defect or 
omission apparent or alleged by the accused.
 


On being detailed for duty 
he should—
 


        (a)  Obtain a copy 
of the charge-sheet and summary of evidence, and enquire whether there is any 
correspondence or other material relative to the case, which he should peruse 
and note.
 


        (b)  If he thinks 
there is any legal defect, irregularity or serious omission in either the 
charge-sheet or the summary of evidence, he should refer to the CO of the 
accused’s unit. The ability to detect irregularities connotes a working 
knowledge of the Army Rule 1954, and of the laws of evidence.
 


        (c)  Satisfy 
himself that Army Rules 33 and 34 and in the case of joint trial Army Rule 35, 
have been complied with.
 


        (d)  Satisfy 
himself that proper steps are being taken to secure the attendance of all 
necessary witnesses.
 


        (e)  Obtain or 
repair a record of the accused’s service (IAFD-905) for production at the trial 
if required. This form must be signed by the officer having the custody of the 
Regimental book.
 


         (f)  Consider 
whether an opening address is desirable, or is likely to be required from him by 
the court [Army Rule 56(3)]. If so, prepare such an opening address, setting out 
in the form of a narrative the facts which are alleged against the accused, and 
the nature of the evidence by which those facts are to be proved. The opening 
address must be as impartial as he can make it, free from unnecessary comment, 
denunciation or prejudice. There must be no reference in it to any allegation 
which is not to be proved in evidence subsequently at the trial. An opening 
address is not ordinarily required in disciplinary cases of a simple nature, but 
is valuable where accounts are involved or the evidence is largely 
circumstantial.
 


        (g)  On the morning 
of the trial, take with him to the court a certificate by a medical officer 
stating that he has examined the accused on that morning and, that he is fit for 
trial.
 


        (h)  Assure himself 
that all witnesses and necessary exhibits are present.
 


38. Duties at the trial—
 


        (a)  On the opening 
of the court the prosecutor presents the medical certificate to the Presiding 
Officer.
 


        (b)  If any 
material witness is absent, the prosecutor should inform the court at once, and 
if necessary, apply for an adjournment (Army Rule 138.)
 


        (c)  If a court of 
inquiry has been held respecting a matter upon which a charge against the 
accused is founded, the prosecutor should hand to the court a list of the names 
of the officers who sat on the court of inquiry. The written record of the 
proceedings of such court of inquiry must be laid before the court-martial (Army 
Rule 41).
 


        (d)  As to the 
prosecutor’s right to address the court and call witnesses in reply in the event 
of a special plea or plea in bar of trial, see Army Rules 49, 51 and 53.
 


        (e)  Where the 
accused pleads “Guilty”, the duties of the prosecutor are confined to calling 
such witnesses as may be necessary if the summary be insufficient [Army Rule 
54(3)], and producing IAFD-905.
 


                  Note.—If 
the accused in a statement with reference to the charge or in mitigation says 
something which is inconsistent with his plea, the prosecutor should call the 
attention of the court to Army Rule 54(5), and prepare to call his witnesses as 
on a plea of “Not Guilty”.
 


         (f)  Where the 
accused pleads “Not Guilty”, the prosecutor makes his opening address, if any, 
and if it is in writing hands it in and calls his first witness.
 


        (g)  Before calling 
his witnesses, and as the case proceeds, the prosecutor must consider whether he 
should call all those whose evidence is in the summary (or abstract) of 
evidence, and whether it is his duty to call as a witness any person whose 
evidence is not contained in summary (Army Rule 134 and 135).
 


        (h)  As to 
accomplices as witnesses for the prosecution see para 4 ante.
 


         (i)  After a 
witness for the prosecution has been sworn or affirmed, the prosecutor will 
ascertain the witness’s No., Rank, Name, unit, station, address, occupation, 
etc, as may be material and will elicit from the witness the relevant facts 
to which the witness can speak. This may be done by means of questions of a 
non-leading character or by permitting the witness to tell his own story, 
questions being subsequently asked to make good any omissions. A series of short 
simple questions will generally assist the witness to recount facts in 
chronological order, and the Presiding Officer or JA in making the record.
 


         (j)  It may happen 
that a question in cross-examination has been so framed as to compel the witness 
to answer simply “Yes"or"No”, whereas there is within the prosecutor’s knowledge 
an explanation which should in fairness be made. In such a case the prosecutor 
may in re-examination refer the witness to that question and answer, and ask him 
if he has anything to add or explain.
 


                  The 
prosecutor should not dismiss a witness until he has ascertained whether the 
court desires to question him and until Army Rule 141 (2), (3), (4) has been 
complied with.
 


        (k)  The prosecutor 
must take care that each exhibit which he desires to put before the court is 
produced and identified by one of his witnesses. If an exhibit (e.g. the 
property in respect of which theft is alleged to have been committed) is to be 
referred to by more than one witnesses, each witness who refers to it must be 
invited to look at the exhibit, and say whether he identifies it. If the 
prosecutor is himself producing documents he should do so, after being sworn or 
affirmed as a witness, before he calls his other witnesses [Army Rule 56(5) ]. 
Neither the prosecutor nor a witness may refer to the contents of a document 
which is not before the court, unless evidence is given accounting for its 
absence.
 


         (l)  The 
prosecutor having called his witnesses the case for the prosecution is closed. 
The subsequent procedure depends upon the exercise by the accused of his rights 
and is fully set out in Army Rules 58 and 59.
 


       (m)  If the accused 
calls any witnesses to the facts, it is the duty of the prosecutor to assist the 
court to test the value of their evidence by cross-examination. The result of 
omission to cross-examine is frequently that the evidence for the defence stands 
unchallenged, and the prosecutor cannot properly, in a subsequent address, 
characterise as untrue a defence which he has not attempted, by question to the 
witnesses at the proper time, to impugn cross- examination is not limited to the 
matters dealt with in the examination-in-chief. It must, however, be confirming 
to matters relevant, directly or indirectly, to the issue. Leading questions may 
be asked in cross-examination, but not questions which assume that facts have 
been given in evidence which have not been given. As to calling witnesses in 
reply to the defence, see Army Rule 143.
 


        (n)  The 
desirability of making a closing address at the appropriate time as provided in 
Army Rules 58 and 59, it is a matter for the prosecutor’s discretion. If there 
is any evidence or argument put forward by the defence which he thinks might 
seriously mislead the court, he should comment on it. He is entitled to sum up 
the evidence generally and to point out any weakness in the defence, and to 
suggest the inference which the court may draw from the fact which has not been 
proved in evidence.
 


        (o)  If the accused 
is convicted on any charge, the prosecutor or some other person in a position to 
do so, is sworn or affirmed (if he has not already been sworn or affirmed as a 
witness in the case) and produces evidence (IAFD-905) of the character, age, 
service, rank, etc., of the accused.
 


DUTIES OF DEFENDING OFFICER
 


39. Duties before trial.—
 


        (a)  The defending 
officer, like the prosecutor requires a working knowledge of the Army Rules, 
1954 and of the laws of evidence. He must also make himself acquainted with the 
details of the case.
 


        (b)  The proper 
preparation of the defence.
 


              (i) Study of 
the charge-sheet and summary of evidence and consideration of legal points which 
he may raise, or which may arise upon them, e.g., objection to a charge, 
plea to the jurisdiction, plea in bar of trial, admissibility of a confession or 
of other evidence.
 


             (ii) 
Ascertaining from the accused what is his answer, if any, to each charge.
 


            (iii) 
Communication with possible witnesses for the defence, to ascertain if they are 
able to give evidence in support of the accused’s case, and the taking of 
appropriate steps to secure their attendance at the trial [Army Rules 34(1) and 
136].
 


                  Note.—He 
is not entitled to interview witnesses for the prosecution without special 
authority.
 


        (c)  The defending 
officer must bear in mind that the ultimate responsibility for the decision on 
the plea which is to be offered on each charge must rest upon the accused 
himself. He may properly advise on this point, but should put no pressure on the 
accused, except to dissuade him from pleading guilty, where he appears to have 
an answer, however, slight, to the charge. The defending officer’s duty at the 
trial will be to present the accused’s defence in the best possible manner. He 
may properly prepare arguments on fact of law, which his own reason of ingenuity 
may suggest, but it would be improper for him to advise or suggest to the 
accused on account of the facts, other than that which the accused himself 
desires to give.
 


        (d)  The defending 
officer is not called upon to judge the truth or otherwise of the accused’s 
defence, nor is he permitted to express his own opinion or belief (Army Rule 
100). To aviod, however, giving countenance to a line of defence which is 
incompatible with his duty as an officer, he should apply through his CO to the 
convening officer for permission to withdraw from the case.
 


40. Duties at the trial.—
 


        (a)  Having the 
rights, duties and obligations of counsel, the defending officer must himself 
conduct the case as representing the accused, i.e., he will himself 
cross-examine witness for the defence, take any objections, make any 
submissions, and address the court on the accused’s behalf.
 


        (b)  The defending 
officer has the right to make an application for adjournment [Army Rule 34(4)] 
and to address the court in support of it. It should not be made on the ground 
of technical irregularity or omission, merely as a protest, where no benefit can 
accrue to the presentation of the defence from the postponement of the trial.
 


        (c)  It is the 
defending officer’s duty to question each witness for the prosecution on any 
matter which is to be alleged in defence insofar as this matter is or should be 
within the witness’s knowledge. As to injurious question, see para 110.
 


        (d)  The defending 
officer may take objection to any question put by the prosecutor to a witness 
for the prosecution on one of the following grounds; the objection should be 
made if possible before the witness answers [Army Rule 141 (1)]:—
 


              (i) That it 
is a leading question.
 


             (ii) That is 
invites hearsay, or on account of an involuntary confession, or evidence of the 
accused’s bad character when that character has not been put in issue, etc.
 


        (e)  At the close 
of the case for the prosecution, the defending officer may submit that the 
accused has no case to answer, and therefore should not be called upon for his 
defence, because, the prosecution have not produced evidence in support of one 
or more essentials in the charge (Army Rule 57).
 


                  Note.—This 
submission must be to the effect that there is no evidence at all on the point 
or points, and not that the evidence is untrustworthy.
 


         (f)  Where a 
witness not examined at the summary of evidences is called by the prosecutor, 
the defending officer may apply for any adjournment, or [postponement of 
cross-examination (Army Rule 135).
 


        (g)  The defending 
officer is entitled to consult the JA, if one has been appointed, on any 
question of law or procedure relative to the charge or trial [Army Rule 105(1)].
 


        (h)  The defending 
officer must throughout the proceedings, treat the court with respect and 
condour.
