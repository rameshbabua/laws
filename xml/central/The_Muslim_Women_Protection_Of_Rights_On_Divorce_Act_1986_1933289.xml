Order for payment of maintenance.—
<section><number>1</number>
Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing provisions of this Act or in
any other law for the time being in force, where the Magistrate is satisfied
that a divorced woman has not re-married and is not able to maintain herself
after the iddat period, he may make an order directing such of her
relatives as would be entitled to inherit her property on her death according to
Muslim law to pay such reasonable and fair maintenance to her as he may
determine fit and proper, having regard to the needs of the divorced woman, the
standard of life enjoyed by her during her marriage and the means of such
relatives and such maintenance shall be payable by such relatives in the
proportions in which they would inherit her property and at such periods as he
may specify in his order:
 Provided
that where such divorced woman has children, the Magistrate shall order only
such children to pay maintenance to her, and in the event of any such children
being unable to pay such maintenance, the Magistrate shall order the parents of
such divorced woman to pay maintenance to her:
 Provided
further that if any of the parents is unable to pay his or her share of the
maintenance ordered by the Magistrate on the ground of his or her not having the
means to pay the same, the Magistrate may, on proof of such inability being
furnished to him, order that the share of such relatives in the maintenance
ordered by him be paid by such of the other relatives as may appear to the
Magistrate to have the means of paying the same in such proportions as the
Magistrate may think fit to order.
 </section><section><number>2</number>
Where a divorced woman is unable to maintain herself and she has no relative as
mentioned in sub-section (1) or such relatives or any one of them have not
enough means to pay the maintenance ordered by the Magistrate or the other
relatives have not the means to pay the shares of those relatives whose shares
have been ordered by the Magistrate to be paid by such other relatives under the
second proviso to sub-section (1), the Magistrate may, by order direct the State
Wakf Board established under section 9 of the Wakf Act, 1954 (29 of 1954), or
under any other law for the time being in force in a State, functioning in the
area in which the woman resides, to pay such maintenance as determined by him
under sub-section (1) or, as the case may be, to pay the shares of such of the
relatives who are unable to pay, at such periods as he may specify in his order.
