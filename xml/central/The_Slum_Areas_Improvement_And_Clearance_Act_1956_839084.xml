The 
    Slum Areas (Improvement  

    and Clearance) Act, 1956
 

 
 

 
 



The Schedule
 


(See section 15)
 



Principles for determination of the net 
    average
    monthly income
 


1. The competent authority shall first 
    determine the gross rent actually derived by the owner of the land acquired 
    including any building on such land during the period of five consecutive 
    years referred to in sub-section (1) of section 15.
 


2. For such determination the competent 
    authority may hold any local inquiry and obtain, if necessary, certified 
    copies of extracts from the property tax assessment books of the municipal 
    or other local authority concerned showing the rental value of such land.
 


3. The net average monthly income referred to 
    in sub-section (1) of section 15 shall be sixty per cent. of the average 
    monthly gross rent which shall be one-sixtieth of the gross rent during the 
    five consecutive years as determined by the competent authority under 
    paragraph 1.
 


4. Forty per cent. of the gross monthly rental 
    referred to above shall not be taken into consideration in determining the 
    net average monthly income but shall be deducted in lieu of the expenditure 
    which the owner of the land would normally incur for payment of any property 
    tax to the municipal or other local authority, for collection charges, 
    income-tax or bad debts as well as for works of repair and maintenance of 
    the buildings, if any, on the land.
 


5. Where the land or any portion thereof has 
    been unoccupied or the owner has not been in receipt of any rent for the 
    occupation of the land during the whole or any part of the said period of 
    five years, the gross rent shall be taken to be the income which the owner 
    would in fact have derived if the land had been leased out for rent during 
    the said period, and for this purpose the rent actually derived from the 
    land during a period prior or subsequent to the period during which it 
    remained vacant or from similar land in the vicinity shall be taken into 
    account.
