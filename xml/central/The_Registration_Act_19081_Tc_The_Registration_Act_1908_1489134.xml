 COMMENTS
 <subsubsubsection><number>i</number> An 
        instrument of gift of immovable property requires registration under 
        this Act, whatever be the value of the property; Charan v. 
        Sucha, (1921) 4 Lah LJ 7. 
 </subsubsubsection><subsubsubsection><number>ii</number> The words 
        'create', 'limit' or 'extinguish' and 'right', 'title' or 'interest' 
        imply a definite change of legal relation to the property by an expression of 
        will embodied in the document. The word 'declare' is ejusdem genesis 
        with the words 'create', 'assign' or 'limit'. It implies a 
        declaration of will, not a mere statement of a fact; Sakharan v. 
        Madan, (1881) 5 Bom
232 approved by Privy Council in Bageshwari Charan v. 
        Jagarnath Kuari, (1931) 59 IA 130, wherein it stated: "The 
        distinction is between a mere recital of a fact and something which in 
        itself creates a title." 
 When it is 
        necessary to determine whether an instrument other than a deed of gift 
        purports or operates to create an interest of the value of Rs. 100 or 
        upwards in immovable property within the meaning of section 17(1)(b) the 
        test of value is the consideration stated in the instrument; Nana 
        v. Anant, (1877) 2 Bom 353. 
 A deposit of 
        title deeds with the creditor by the debtor with the intent to create a 
        security implies in law a contract between the parties to create a 
        mortgage and no registered instrument is required under section 59 of 
        the Transfer of Property Act as in other case of mortgage. But if the 
        parties choose to reduce the contract to writing, this implication of 
        law is excluded by their express bargain and the document will be the 
        sole evidence of its terms. In such a case the deposit and the document 
        both form integral parts of the transaction and are essential in the 
        creation of the mortgage. In such a case the document which constitutes the bargain 
        regarding security requires registration under section 17 of the Act as 
        a non-testamentary instrument creating interest in immovable property 
        where the value is Rs. 100 or upwards; United Bank of India Ltd. 
        v. Lakhram Sonaram &amp; Co., AIR 1965 SC 1591. 
 An instrument of 
        partition of immovable property requires registration as it declares an 
        interest in immovable property provided, however, the value of the 
        interest so declared is Rs. 100 or upwards; Siromoni v. 
        Hemkumar, AIR 1968 SC 1299. 
 But a writing 
        which merely states that there has in time past been a partition is not 
        a declaration of will but a mere statement of fact and it does not 
        require registration; Venkataraju v. Yudhkondalu,
AIR 1958 AP 147. 
 </subsubsubsection><subsubsubsection><number>iii</number> The term 
        'consideration' used in this clause is a technical term. It implies that 
        the person to whom the money is paid himself declares, limits or 
        extinguishes his interest in immovable property in consideration of such 
        payment; Shidlingapa v. Chenbasapa, (1819) 4 Bom 
        235. 
 A lease for one 
        year containing an option to the tenant to revenue for a further period 
        of one year or any other term is not a lease for a term exceeding one 
        year and does not requires registration under this clause; Boyd 
        v. Kreig, (1890) 17 Cal 548 dissenting from; 
        Bhobani v. Shibnath, (1886) 13 Cal 113. 
 A lease for the 
        life of the lessee is a lease for a term exceeding one year as it 
        entitles the lessee to hold for more than one year if he lives so long. 
        It is not a lease 
        terminable at the end of a year or at the option of the lessor. It 
        therefore requires registration; Parstrotam v. Nana,
(1893) 18 Bom 109. 
 </subsubsubsection><subsubsubsection><number>iv</number> Sub-section 
        2(i) of section 17 merely provided that nothing in sub-section 1(b) 
        applied to a composition deed, but that did not mean that if a document 
        required registration under 
        another enactment, it was valid without registration; Govind Ram 
        v. Madan Gopal, (1944) 721.A 76: AIR 1945 PC 74. 
 </subsubsubsection><subsubsubsection><number>v</number> A consent 
        decree purporting to create a gift requires registration under section 
        17(1)(a) and is not exempt from registration under section 17(2)(vi); 
        Kauleshwari v. Surajnath Rai, AIR 1957 Pat 456. 
 </subsubsubsection><subsubsubsection><number>vi</number> The only 
        test under the present clause is whether the receipt purports to 
        extinguish the mortgage. If it does, it requires registration, but not 
        otherwise. A receipt for payment of money under a mortgage (other than 
        an endorsement on a mortgage-deed) issued by a mortgage mentioning not 
        only the payment of the full mortgage amount but also the extinction of 
        mortgage requires registration; Gurdial Singh v. Kartar 
        Singh, AIR 1964 Punj 141. 
 A deed of 
        adoption as distinguished from an authority to adopt does not require 
        registration; Vishwanth Ramji v. Rahibai, AIR 1931 
        Bom 105: 128 IC 901.
