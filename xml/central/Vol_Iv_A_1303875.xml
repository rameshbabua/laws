<number> 4</number> " Easement" defined.- An easement is a right which the owner or 
occupier of certain land possesses, as such, for the beneficial 
enjoyment of that land, to do and continue to do something, or to 
prevent and continue to prevent something being done, in or upon, or 
in respect of, certain other land not his own.
Dominant and servient heritages and owners. The land for the 
beneficial enjoyment of which the right exists is called the dominant 
heritage, and the owner or occupier thereof the dominant owner; the 
land on which the liability is imposed is called the servient 
heritage, and the owner or occupier thereof the servient owner.

Explanation.-- In the first and second clauses of this section, 
the expression" land" includes also things permanently attached to the 
earth: the expression" beneficial enjoyment" includes also possible 
convenience, remote advantage, and even a mere amenity; and the 
expression" to do something" includes removal and appropriation by the 
dominant owner, for the beneficial enjoyment of the dominant heritage, 
of any part of the soil of the servient heritage or anything growing 
or subsisting thereon.

A continuous easement is one whose enjoyment is, or may be, 
continual without the act of man.

enjoyment.

An apparent easement is one the existence of which is shown by 
some permanent sign which, upon careful inspection by a competent 
person, would be visible to him.

A non- apparent easement is one that has no such sign.

</pagenote> 
</pagefootnote>


Each of the said periods of twenty years shall be taken to be a 
period ending within two years next before the institution of the suit 
wherein the claim to which such period relates is contested.

Explanation I.-- Nothing is an enjoyment within the meaning of 
this section when it has been had in pursuance of an agreement with 
the owner or occupier of the property over which the right is claimed, 
and it is apparent from the agreement that such right has not been 
granted as an easement, or, if granted as an easement, that it has 
been granted for a limited period, or subject to a condition on the 
fulfilment of which it is to cease.

Explanation II.-- Nothing is an interruption within the meaning of 
this section unless where there is an actual cessation of the 
enjoyment by reason of an obstruction by the act of some person other 
than the claimant, and unless such obstruction is submitted to or 
acquiesced in for one year after the claimant has notice thereof and 
of the person making or authorizing the same to be made.

Explanation III.-- Suspension of enjoyment in pursuance of a 
contract between the dominant and servient owners is not an 
interruption within the meaning of this section.

Explanation IV.-- In the case of an easement to pollute water, the 
said period of twenty years begins when the pollution first prejudices 
perceptibly the servient heritage.

in the dominant heritage, or the occupier of such heritage, may 
institute a suit for compensation for the disturbance of the easement 
or of any right accessory thereto; provided that the disturbance has 
actually caused substantial damage to the plaintiff.
Explanation I.-- The doing of any act likely to injure the 
plaintiff by affecting the evidence of the easement, or by materially 
diminishing the value of the dominant heritage, is substantial damage 
within the meaning of this section and section 34.

Explanation II.-- Where the easement disturbed is a right to the 
free passage of light passing to the openings in a house, no damage is 
substantial within the meaning of this section unless it falls within 
the first Explanation, or interferes materially with the physical 
comfort of the plaintiff, or prevents him from carrying on his 
accustomed business in the dominant heritage as beneficially as he had 
done previous to instituting the suit.

Explanation III.-- Where the easement disturbed is a right to the 
free passage of air to the openings in a house, damage is substantial 
within the meaning of this section if it interferes materially with 
the physical comfort of the plaintiff, though it is not injurious to 
his health.

<number>a</number>where the dominant owner expressly authorizes an act of 
a permanent nature to be done on the servient heritage, 
the necessary consequence of which is to prevent his 
future enjoyment of the easement, and such act is done 
in pursuance of such authority;

</section>

<section><tid>1442345</tid>
<number>b</number>where any permanent alteration is made in the dominant

<number> 47</number> Extinction by non- enjoyment.- A continuous easement is 
extinguished when it totally ceases to be enjoyed as such for an 
unbroken period of twenty years.
A discontinuous easement is extinguished when, for a like period, 
it has not been enjoyed as such.

Such period shall be reckoned, in the case of a continuous 
easement, from the day on which its enjoyment was obstructed by the 
servient owner, or rendered impossible by the dominant owner; and, in 
the case of a discontinuous easement, from the day on which it was 
last enjoyed by any person as dominant owner:

Provided that if, in the case of a discontinuous easement, the 
dominant owner, within such period, registers, under the Indian 
Registration Act, <footcitenum>18771</footcitenum> (3 of <year>1877</year>), a declaration of his intention 
to retain such easement, it shall not be extinguished until a period 
of twenty years has elapsed from the date of the registration.

<pagefootnote><pagenum>25</pagenum>
<pagenote><number>1</number>See now the Indian Registration Act, <year>1908</year> (16 of <year>1908</year>).

Where an easement can be legally enjoyed only at a certain place, 
or at certain times, or between certain hours, or for a particular 
purpose, its enjoyment during the said period at another place, or at 
other times, or between other hours, or for another purpose, does not 
prevent its extinction under this section.

The circumstance that, during the said period, no one was in 
possession of the servient heritage, or that the easement could not be 
enjoyed, or that a right accessory thereto was enjoyed, or that the 
dominant owner was not aware of its existence, or that he enjoyed it 
in ignorance of his right to do so, does not prevent its extinction 
under this section.

An easement is not extinguished under this section-

<section><tid>1860471</tid>
<number>a</number>where the cessation is in pursuance of a contract 
between the dominant and servient owners;

</section>

<section><tid>1886065</tid>
<number>b</number>where the dominant heritage is held in co- ownership, 
and one of the co- owners enjoys the easement within the 
said period, or

</section>

<section><tid>924101</tid>
<number>c</number>where the easement is a necessary easement.
Where several heritages are respectively subject to rights of way 
for the benefit of a single heritage, and the ways are continuous, 
such rights shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to be a 
single easement.

Illustration

A has, as annexed to his house, rights of way from the high road 
thither over the heritages X and Z and the intervening heritage Y. 
Before the twenty years expire, A exercises his right of way over X. 
His rights of way over Y and Z are not extinguished.

<number>48</number>Extinction of accessory rights.- When an easement is 
extinguished, the rights (if any) accessory thereto are also 
extinguished.
Illustration

A has an easement to draw water from B' s well. As accessory 
thereto, he has a right of way over B' s land to and from the well. The 
easement to draw water is extinguished under section 47. The right of 
way is also extinguished.



</article>



<article><tid>550339</tid>
<number>49</number>Suspension of easement.- An easement is suspended when the 
dominant owner becomes entitled to possession of the servient heritage 
for a limited interest therein, or when the servient owner becomes 
entitled to possession of the dominant heritage for a limited interest 
therein.

<article><tid>139911</tid>
<number>50</number>Servient owner not entitled to require continuance.- The 
servient owner has no right to require that an easement be continued; 
and, notwithstanding the provisions of section 26, he is not entitled 
to compensation for damage caused to the servient heritage in 
consequence of the extinguishment or suspension of the easement, if 
the dominant owner has given to the servient owner such notice as will 
enable him, without unreasonable expense, to protect the servient 
heritage from such damage.
Compensation for damage caused by extinguishment or suspension.- 
Where such notice has not been given, the servient owner is entitled 
to compensation for damage caused to the servient heritage in 
consequence of such extinguishment or suspension.

Illustration

A, in exercise of an easement, diverts to his canal the water of 
B' s stream. The diversion continues for many years, and during that 
time the bed of the stream partly fills up. A then abandons his 
easement, and restores the stream to its ancient course. B' s land is 
consequently flooded. B sues A for compensation for the damage caused 
by the flooding. It is proved that A gave B a month' s notice of his 
intention to abandon the easement, and that such notice was sufficient 
to enable B, without unreasonable expense, to have prevented the 
damage. The suit must be dismissed.

<article><tid>1239299</tid>
<number>51</number>Revival of easements.- An easement extinguished under section 
 45 revives (a) when the destroyed heritage is, before twenty years 
have expired, restored by the deposit of alluvion; (b) when the 
destroyed heritage is a servient building and before twenty years have 
expired such building is rebuilt upon the same site; and (c) when the 
destroyed heritage is a dominant building and before twenty years have 
expired such building is rebuilt upon the same site and in such a 
manner as not to impose a greater burden on the servient heritage.
An easement extinguished under section 46 revives when the grant 
or bequest by which the unity of ownership was produced is set aside 
by the decree of a competent Court. A necessary easement extinguished 
under the same section revives when the unity of ownership ceases from 
any other cause.

A suspended easement revives if the cause of suspension is 
removed before the right is extinguished under section 47.

Illustration

A, as the absolute owner of field Y, has a right of way thither 
over B' s field Z. A obtains from B a lease of Z for twenty years. The 
easement is suspended so long as A remains lessee of Z. But when A 
assigns the lease to C, or surrenders it to B, the right of way 
revives.
