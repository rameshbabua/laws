<section><number>1</number> If, at any 
    time, the Board is of the opinion that a Developer—

<number>a</number>    is unable to discharge the functions or 
    perform the duties imposed on him by or under the provisions of this Act or 
    rules made thereunder; or 
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>b</number>    has persistently defaulted in complying

 </subsection><subsection>
<number>c</number>    has violated the terms and conditions 
    of the letter of approval; or 
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>d</number>    whose financial position is such that 
    he is unable to fully and efficiently discharge the duties and obligations 
    imposed on him by the letter of approval, and 
 
the 
    circumstances exist which render it necessary for it in public interest so 
    to do, the Board may, on application, or with the consent of the Developer, 
    or otherwise, for reasons to be recorded in writing, suspend the letter of 
    approval, granted to the Developer for a whole or part of his area 
    established as Special Economic Zone, for a period not exceeding one year 
    and appoint an Administrator to discharge the functions of the Developer in 
    accordance with the terms and conditions of the letter of approval and 
    manage the Special Economic Zone accordingly. 
 </subsection></section><section>
<number>2</number> Consequent 
    upon appointment of an Administrator, the management of the Special Economic 
    Zone of the Developer referred to in sub‑section (1) shall vest in the 
    Administrator. 
 </section><section>
<number>3</number> No letter 
    of approval shall be suspended under sub‑section (1) unless the Board has 
    given to the Developer not less than three months’ notice, in writing, 
    stating the grounds on which it proposes to suspend the letter of approval, 
    and has considered any cause shown by the Developer within the period of 
    that notice, against the proposed suspension. 
 </section><section>
<number>4</number> The Board 
    may, instead of suspending the letter of approval under sub‑section (1), 
    permit it to remain in force subject to such further terms and conditions as 
    it thinks fit to impose, and any further terms or conditions so imposed 
    shall be binding upon and be complied with by the Developer and shall be of 
    like force and effect as if they were contained in the letter of approval. 
 </section><section>

    suspension shall take effect. 
 </section><section>
<number>6</number> Upon 
    suspension of the letter of approval under sub‑section (1), the Special 
    Economic Zone of the Developer referred to in sub‑section (5) shall vest in 
    the Administrator under sub‑section (2) for a period not exceeding one year 
    or up to the date on which the letter of approval for such Special Economic 
    Zone is transferred, whichever is earlier, in accordance with the provisions 
    contained in sub‑sections (7) and (9), as the case may be. 
 </section><section>
<number>7</number> Where the 
    Board has given notice for suspension of letter of approval under 
    sub‑section (5), the Developer may, after prior approval of the Board, 
    transfer his letter of approval to any person who is found eligible by the 
    Board for grant of such approval. 
 </section><section>
<number>8</number> If at any 
    time, it appears to the Board that the purpose of the order appointing the 
    Administrator has been fulfilled or that for any reason it is undesirable 
    that the order of appointment should remain in force, the Board may cancel 
    the order and thereupon the Administrator shall be divested of the 
    management of the Special Economic Zone which shall, unless otherwise 
    directed by the Board, again vest in the person, being the Developer, in 
    whom it was vested immediately prior to the date of appointment of the

    to the transferee, shall cease absolutely except for any liabilities which 
    have accrued prior to that date; 
 </subsection><subsection>
