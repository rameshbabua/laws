 <article><number>37</number> Investigation into restrictive 
trade practices by Commission.—
<section><number>1</number> The Commission may inquire 
into any restrictive trade practice, whether the agreement, if any, relating 
thereto has been registered under section 35 or not, which may come before it

 <article>
<number>38</number> Presumption as to 
the public interest.—
<section><number>1</number> 
For the purposes of any proceedings before the Commission under section 37, a 
restrictive trade practice shall be deemed to be prejudicial to the public 
interest unless the Commission is satisfied of any one or more of the following 
circumstances, that is to say—
 <subsection>
        <number>a</number>  that the 
restriction is reasonably necessary having regard to the character of the goods 
to which it applies, to protect the public against injury (whether to persons or 
to premises) in connection with the consumption, installation or use of those 
goods;
 </subsection><subsection>
        <number>b</number>  that the 
removal of the restriction would deny to the public as purchasers, consumers or 
users of any goods, other specific and substantial benefits or advantages 
enjoyed or likely to be enjoyed by them as such, whether by virtue of the 
restriction itself or of any arrangements or operations resulting therefrom;
 </subsection><subsection>
        <number>c</number>  that the 
restriction is reasonably necessary to counteract measures taken by any one 
person not party to the agreement with a view to preventing or restricting 
competition in or in relation to the trade or business in which the persons 
party thereto are engaged;
 </subsection><subsection>
        <number>d</number>  that the 
restriction is reasonably necessary to enable the persons party to the agreement 
to negotiate fair terms for the supply of goods to, or the acquisition of goods 
from any one person not party thereto who controls a preponderant part of the 
trade or business of acquiring or supplying such goods, or for the supply of 
goods to any person not party to the agreement and not carrying on such a trade 
or business who, either alone or in combination with any other such persons, 
controls a preponderant part of the market for such goods;
 </subsection><subsection>
        <number>e</number>  that, having 
regard to the conditions actually obtaining or reasonably foreseen at the time 
of the application, the removal of the restriction would be likely to have a 
serious and persistent adverse effect on the general level of unemployment in an 
area, or in areas taken together, in which a substantial proportion of the 
trade, or industry to which the agreement relates is situated;
 </subsection><subsection>
         <number>f</number>  that, having 
regard to the conditions actually obtaining or reasonably foreseen at the time 
of the application, the removal of the restriction would be likely to cause a 
reduction in the volume or earnings of the export business which is substantial 
either in relation to the whole export business of India or in relation to the 
whole business (including export business) of the said trade or industry;
 </subsection><subsection>
        <number>g</number>  that the 
restriction is reasonably required for purposes in connection with the 
maintenance of any other restriction accepted by the parties, whether under the 
same agreement or under any other agreement between them, being a restriction 
which is found by the Commission not to be contrary to the public interest upon 
grounds other than those specified in this paragraph, or has been so found in 
previous proceedings before the Commission; 

1[***]
 </subsection><subsection>
        <number>h</number>  that the 
restriction does not directly or indirectly restrict or discourage competition 
to any material degree in may relevant trade or industry and is not likely to do 
so;
 

           2[(i)  
that such restriction has been expressly authorised and approved by the Central 
Government;
 </subsection><subsection>
         <number>j</number>  that such 
restriction is necessary to meet the requirements of the defence of India or any 
part thereof, or for the security of the State; or
 </subsection><subsection>
        <number>k</number>  that the 
restriction is necessary to ensure the maintenance of supply of goods and 
services essential to the community,]
 
and is further satisfied 
(in any such case) that the restriction is not unreasonable having regard to the 
balance between those circumstances and any detriment to the public or to 
persons not parties to the agreement (being purchasers, consumers or users of 
goods produced or sold by such parties, or persons engaged or seeking to become 
engaged in the trade or business of selling such goods or of producing or 
selling similar goods) resulting or likely to result from the operation of the 
restriction.
 </subsection></section><section>
<number>2</number> In this section 
“purchases”, “consumers” and “users” include persons purchasing, consuming or 
using for the purpose or in course of trade or business or for public purposes; 
and references in this section to any one person include references to any two 
or more persons being inter-connected undertakings or individuals carrying on

 <article>
<number>39</number> Special conditions 
for avoidance of conditions for maintaining re-sale prices.—
<section><number>1</number> 
Without prejudice to the provisions of this Act with respect to registration and 
to any of the powers of the Commission or of the Central Government under this 
Act, any term or condition of a contract for the sale of goods by a person to a 
wholesaler or retailer or any agreement between a person and a wholesaler or 
retailer relating to such sale shall be void in so far as it purports to 
establish or provide for the establishment of minimum prices to be charged on 
the re-sale of goods in India.
 </section><section>
<number>2</number> After the commencement 
of this Act, no supplier of goods whether directly or through any person or 
association of persons acting on his behalf shall notify to dealers or otherwise 
publish on or in relation to any goods, a price stated or calculated to be 
understood as the minimum price which may be charged on the re-sale of the goods 
in India.
 </section><section>
<number>3</number> This section shall 
apply to patented articles (including articles made by a patented process and 
articles made under any trade mark) as it applies to other goods and notice of 
any term or condition which is void by virtue of this section or which would be 
so void if included in a contract of sale or agreement relating to the sale of 
such article shall be of no effect for the purpose of limiting the right of a 
dealer to dispose of that article without infringement of the patent or trade 
mark, as the case may be:
 
Provided that nothing in 
this section shall affect the validity as between the parties and their 
successors, of any term or condition of a licence granted by the proprietor of a 
patent or 

1[trade mark or by 
a licencee of patent or trade mark] or of any assignment of a patent or trade 
mark, so far as it regulates the price at which articles produced or processed 
by the licencee or the assignee may be sold by him.
 
Explanation.—In 
this section and in section 40, the term “supplier”, in relation to supply of 
any goods, means a person who supplies goods to any person for the ultimate 
purpose of re-sale and includes a wholesaler, and the term “dealer” includes a 
supplier and a retailer.
 
 



</section></article> 

  
 <article>
<number>40</number> Prohibition of 
other measures for maintaining re-sale prices.—
<section><number>1</number> 
Without prejudice to the provisions of this Act with respect to registration and 
to any of the powers of the Commission or of the Central Government under this 
Act, no supplier shall withhold supplies of any goods from any wholesaler or 
retailer seeking to obtain them for re-sale in India on the ground that the 
wholesaler or retailer—
 <subsection>
        <number>a</number>  has sold in 
India at a price below re-sale price, goods obtained, either directly or 
indirectly, from that supplier, or has supplied such goods, either directly or 
indirectly, to a third party who had done so; or
 </subsection><subsection>
        <number>b</number>  is likely if 
the goods are supplied to him to sell them in India at a price below that price 
or supply them, either directly or indirectly, to a third party who would be 
likely to do so.
 </subsection></section><section>
<number>2</number> Nothing contained in 
sub-section (1) shall render it unlawful for a supplier to withhold supplies of 
goods from any wholesaler or retailer or to cause or procure another supplier to 
do so if he has reasonable cause to believe that the wholesaler or the retailer, 
as the case may be, has been using as loss leaders any goods of the same or a 
similar description whether obtained from that supplier or not.
 </section><section>
<number>3</number> A supplier of goods 
shall be deemed to be withholding supplies of goods from a dealer if he—
 <subsection>
        <number>a</number>  refuses or 
fails to supply those goods to the order of the dealer;
 </subsection><subsection>
        <number>b</number>  refuses to 
supply those goods to the dealer except at prices, or on terms or conditions as 
to credit, discount or other matters which are less favourable than those at or 
on which he normally supplies those goods to other dealers carrying on business 
in similar circumstances; or
 </subsection><subsection>
        <number>c</number>  treats a 
dealer, in spite of a contract with such dealer for the supply of goods, in a 
manner less favourable than that in which he normally treats other dealers in 
respect of time or methods of delivery or other matters arising in the 
performance of the contract.
 </subsection></section><section>
<number>4</number> A supplier shall not 
be deemed to be withholding supplies of goods on any of the grounds mentioned in 
sub-section (1), if, in addition to that ground, he has any other ground which 
alone would entitle him to withhold such supplies.
 
Explanation I.—“Re-sale 
price”, in relation to sale of goods of any description, means any price 
notified to the dealer or otherwise published by or on behalf of the supplier of 
the goods in question (whether lawfully or not) as the price or minimum price 
which is to be charged on, or is recommended as appropriate for, a sale of that 
description or any price prescribed or purporting to be prescribed for that 
purpose by any contract or agreement between the wholesaler or retailer and any 
such supplier.
 
Explanation II.—A 
wholesaler or retailer is said to use goods as loss leaders when he re-sells 
them otherwise than in a genuine seasonal or clearance sale not for the purpose 
of making a profit on the re-sale but for the purpose of attracting to the 
establishment at which the goods are sold, customers likely to purchase other 
goods or otherwise for the purpose of advertising his business.

 <article>
<number>41</number> Power of Commission 
to exempt particular classes of goods from sections 39 and 40.—
<section><number>1</number> 
The Commission may, on a reference made to it by the 

1[Director General] 
or any other person interested, by order, direct that goods of any class 
specified in the order shall be exempt from the operation of sections 39 and 40 
if the Commission is satisfied that in default of a system of maintained minimum 
re-sale prices applicable to those goods—
 <subsection>
        <number>a</number>  the quality 
of goods available for sale or the varieties of goods so available would be 
substantially reduced to the detriment of the public as consumers or users of 
those goods, or
 </subsection><subsection>
        <number>b</number>  the prices at 
which the goods are sold by retail would, in general and in the long run, be 
increased to the detriment of the public as such consumers or users, or
 </subsection><subsection>
        <number>c</number>  any necessary 
services actually provided in connection with or after the sale of goods by 
retail would cease to be so provided or would be substantially reduced to the 
detriment of the public as such consumers or users.
 </subsection></section><section>
<number>2</number> On a reference under 
this section in respect of goods of any class which have been the subject of 
proceedings before the Commission under section 31, the Commission may treat as 
conclusive any evidence of fact made in those proceedings.

<number>3</number> Where a notice under 
this section is given to a trade association, the notice may be given to the 
secretary, manager or other similar officer of the association and for the
