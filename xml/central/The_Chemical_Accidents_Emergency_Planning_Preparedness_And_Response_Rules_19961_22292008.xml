Notes.—(a) The threshold 
      quantities set out above relate to each installation or group of 
      installations belonging to the same occupier where the distance between 
      installations is not sufficient to avoid, in foreseeable circumstances, 
      any aggravation of major accident hazards. These threshold quantities 
      apply in any case to each group of installations belonging to the same 
      occupier where the distance between the installations is less than 500 
      metres.
 

(b) For the purpose of 
      determining the threshold quantity of a hazardous chemical at an isolated 
      storage, account shall also be taken of any hazardous chemical which 
      is:—
 

(i)   in that part 
      of any pipeline under the control of the occupier having control of the 
      site, which is within 500 metres of that site and connected to 
      it;
 

(ii)   at any other 
      site under the control of the same occupier any part of the boundary of 
      which is within 500 metres of the said site; and
 

(iii)   in any vehicle, 
      vessel, aircraft or hovercraft under the control of the same occupier 
      which is used for storage purpose either at the site or within 500 metres 
      of it;
 

But no account shall be 
      taken of any hazardous chemical which is in a vehicle, vessel, aircraft or 
      hovercraft and for transporting it.
 

(c) This applies to ammonium 
      nitrate and mixtures of ammonium nitrate where the nitrogen content 
      derived from the ammonium nitrate is greater than 28 per cent by weight 
      and to aqueous solutions of ammonium nitrate where the concentration of 
      ammonium nitrate is greater than 90 per cent by weight.
 

(d) This applies to straight 
      ammonium nitrate fertilizers and to compound fertilizers where the 
      nitrogen content derived from the ammonium nitrate is greater than 28 per 
      cent by weight (a compound fertilizer contains ammonium nitrate together 
      with phosphate and/or potash).
