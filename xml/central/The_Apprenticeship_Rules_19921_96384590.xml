    training between the hours of 10 P.M. and 6 A.M. except with the prior

    with medical leave. If casual leave is preceded or followed by medical

    and towards the cost of training in accordance with rates as specified under 
    Rule 8 of the Apprenticeship Rules, 1991.
 


(6) Except in 
    case of extreme urgency the apprentice shall submit applications for all 
    leave except medical leave to the appropriate authority and obtain sanction 
    before the leave is taken.
 


(7) The  
    apprentice, his/her guardian (in case of minor) declares that no other 
    contract of apprenticeship subsists already between him and any other 
    employer (in respect of minor apprentice, by the guardian) and undertakes 
    that he shall not enter into any other contract of apprenticeship with any 
    other employer (in respect of minor apprentice, by the guardian) before the 
    expiry or termination of the contract of apprenticeship.
 


(8) The 
    apprentice or his/her guardian (in case of minor) shall not enter into  any
     

    other contract of apprenticeship with any other employer in respect of the 
    apprentices mentioned in the first recital before the expiry or termination 
    of the contract of apprenticeship.

    six months of the period of apprenticeship training shall be treated as 
    period on probation. Either party may make an application to the 
    Central/State Apprenticeship Adviser for the  earlier termination of 
    contract and when such an application is made, the party making application 
    shall send by post a copy thereof to the other party to the contract. The 
    Central/State Apprenticeship Adviser after considering the contents of the 
    application and objections, if any, filed by the other party, may terminate 
    the contract, if he is satisfied that the parties to the contract, if any, 
    of them have or has failed to carry out the terms and conditions of the 
    contract and that it is desirable in the interests of the parties or any of 
    them to terminate the same:
 


Provided that 
    the amount as stated in paras I (6) and II (5) of this Schedule shall become 
    payable  by one party to the other accordingly as the failure is on the part 
    of the employer or the apprentice:
 


Provided 
    further that no compensation shall be payable by the employer to the 
    guardian of  the apprentice if the employer makes an application to the 
    Central/State Apprenticeship Adviser during the period the apprentice is on 
    probation for the termination of the contract on the ground that the 
    apprentice on the trade in which he has been engaged and that his guardian 
    has refused to allow him to undergo apprenticeship training in another 
    designated trade for which he is found suitable by the employer and if the 
    Central/State Apprenticeship Adviser, after considering the contents of the 
    application of the employer and the objections, if any, filed by the other 
    party is satisfied that it is desirable in the interests of the parties or 
    any of them to terminate the contract.
 


(10) It shall 
    not be obligatory on the part of the employer to offer any employment to the 
    apprentice on completion or period of his apprenticeship training in  his 
    establishment, nor shall it be obligatory on the part of the apprentice to 
    accept an employment under the employer.
 


(11) Any 
    disagreement or dispute between the employer and the guardian of the 
    apprentice arising out of the contract shall be referred to the 
    Central/State Apprenticeship Adviser for decision and any person aggrieved 
    by the decision of the Central/State Apprenticeship Adviser, may, within 30 
    days from the date of communication to him of such decision, prefer an 
    appeal against the decision to the Central/State Apprenticeship Council and 
    such appeal shall be heard and determined by the Committee of that Council 
    appointed for the purpose. The decision of such committee shall be final.
