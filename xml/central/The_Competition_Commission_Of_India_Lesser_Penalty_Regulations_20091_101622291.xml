 <section><number>a</number> The applicant may be granted benefit of reduction in penalty up to or equal to one hundred per cent, if the applicant is the first to make a vital disclosure by submitting evidence of a cartel, enabling the Commission to form a prima facie opinion regarding the existence of a cartel which is alleged to have violated section 3 of the Act and the Commission did not, at the time of application, have sufficient evidence to form such an opinion:

The designated authority shall, thereafter, within three working days, put up the matter before the Commission for its consideration.

 </section><section><number>5</number> The Commission, through its designated authority, shall provide written acknowledgement on the receipt of the application informing the priority status of the application but merely on that basis, it shall not entitle the applicant for grant of lesser penalty.

 </section><section><number>8</number> Where the benefit of the priority status is not granted to the first applicant, the subsequent applicants shall move up in order of priority for grant of priority status by the Commission and the procedure prescribed above, as in the case of first applicant, shall apply mutatis mutandis . 
 </section><section><number>9</number> The decision of the Commission of granting or rejecting the application for lesser penalty shall be communicated to the applicant.
