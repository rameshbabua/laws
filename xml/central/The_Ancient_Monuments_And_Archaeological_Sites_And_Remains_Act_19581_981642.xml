    Historical Monuments
 
Viceregal Lodge at 
    Shimla is a harbinger of Colonial past, with architecturally grandeur and 
    beauty of Elizabethian Era and stands a mute witness to the transition of 
    independence to the people of India after sustained non-violent struggle by the Father of Nation, Mahatma 
    Gandhi. The Government of India was directed to notify the entire area of 
    the Viceregal Lodge as a protected ancient monument. Thus the protection and 
    preservation of Viceregal Lodge and the appurtenant land as historical 
    heritage has become fait, accompli by the order of the Supreme Court. 
    Supreme Court also directed the Government of India to maintain all national 
    monuments under the respective Acts and to ensure that all of them are 
    properly maintained; Rajeev Mankotia v. Secretary to the President 
    of India, AIR 1997 SC 2766.
