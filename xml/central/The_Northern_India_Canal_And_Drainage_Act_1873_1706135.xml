Whenever it appears to a Divisional Canal- officer duly authorised by 
the State Government that, unless some work is immediately executed, 
such serious damage will happen to any canal or drainage- work as to 
cause sudden and extensive public injury,
and that the labourers necessary for the proper execution thereof 
cannot be obtained in the ordinary manner within the time that can be 
allowed for the execution of such work so as to prevent such injury, 
the said officer may require any person named in such list to furnish 
as many labourers (not exceeding the number which, according to the  
  said list he is liable to supply) as to the said officer seems 
necessary for the immediate execution of such work.

Every requisition so made shall be in writing, and shall state--

time being paid in the neighbourhood for similar work.

In the case of every such labourer, the payment shall continue 
for the whole period during which he is, in consequence of the 
provisions of this part, prevented from following his ordinary 
occupation.

The State Government may <footcitenum>1</footcitenum> direct that the provisions of this 
part shall apply, either permanently or temporarily (as the case may  
  be), to any district or part of a district for the purpose of 
effecting necessary annual silt- clearances, or to prevent the proper
