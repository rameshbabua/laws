  v. Rasaranjan , AIR 2006 SC 3275.

  succession to the property alleging an adoption must prove the factum of 
  adoption and its validity by placing sufficient materials on record; Suma 
  Bewa v. Kunja Bihari Nayak , AIR 1998 Ori 29.

shall be satisfied that the adoption will be for the welfare of the child, due 
consideration being for this purpose given to the wishes of the child having 
regard to the age and understanding of the child and that the applicant for

 THE HINDU ADOPTIONS AND MAINTENANCE ACT, 1956
  
 <article>
<number>10</number> Persons who may be adopted.—No 
person shall be capable of being taken in adoption unless the following 
conditions are fulfilled, namely:—
 <section>         <number>i</number>  he or she is a 
Hindu;
 </section><section>        <number>ii</number>  he or she has not 
already been adopted;
 </section><section>        <number>iii</number>  he or she has not been married, unless there 
is a custom or usage applicable to the parties which permits persons who are 
married being taken in adoption;
 </section><section>       <number>iv</number>  he or she has not completed the age of fifteen 
years, unless there is a custom or usage applicable to the parties which permits 
persons who have completed the age of fifteen years being taken in adoption.




</section></article> 

  
 <article><title><number>11</number> Other conditions for a valid adoption. </title>—In every 
adoption, the following conditions must be complied with:— 
 
 <section><number>i</number> if the adoption is of a son, the adoptive father or mother by whom the 
  adoption is made must not have a Hindu son, son's son or son's son's son 
  (whether by legitimate blood relationship or by adoption) living at the time 
  of adoption; 
 </section><section><number>ii</number> if the adoption is of a daughter, the adoptive father or mother by 
  whom the adoption is made must not have a Hindu daughter or son's daughter 
  (whether by legitimate blood relationship or by adoption) living at the time 
  of adoption; 
 </section><section><number>iii</number> if the adoption is by a male and the person to be adopted is a 
  female, the adoptive father is at least twenty-one years older than the person 
  to be adopted; 
 </section><section><number>iv</number> if the adoption is by a female and the person to be adopted is a male, 
  the adoptive mother is at least twenty-one years older than the person to be 
  adopted; 
 </section><section><number>v</number> the same child may not be adopted simultaneously by two or more 
  persons; 
 </section><section><number>vi</number> the child to be adopted must be actually given and taken in adoption 
  by the parents or guardian concerned or under their authority with intent to 
  transfer the child from the family of its birth 1 [or in the case of an 
  abandoned child or child whose parentage is not known, from the place or 
  family where it has been brought up] to the family of its adoption: 
</section>
 Provided that the performance of datta homam shall not be essential 
to the validity of adoption. 


 
 <section><number>i</number> Provision of section 11 requiring age difference between adoptive 
  mother and adoptive son to be at least 21 years is mandatory in nature. Word 
  ‘must' cannot be read as ‘may'. This breach is fatal to adoption; Hanmant 
  Laxman Salunke (D) by L.Rs. v. Shrirang Narayan Kanse, AIR 2006 
  Bom 123. 
 </section><section><number>ii</number> The defendant's father only wanted that he should be reared up by 
  Sankar and Sasi after the mother's death and there had been no formal ceremony 
  of adoption nor were Sankar and Sasi unfit to have children of their own, 
  thereby negativing the adoption; Urmila Devi v. Hemanta Kumar 
  Mohanta, AIR 1993 Ori 213. 
 </section><section><number>iii</number> The age of the plaintiff was 30 years and that of the adoptive mother 
  48 years six months, thereby contravening the provisions of section 11(iv) as 
  the difference between the plaintiff and mother was only 19 years and not 21 
  years; Nemichand Shantilal Patni v. Basantabai, AIR 1994 Bom 
  235. 
 </section><section><number>iv</number> There was no evidence in hand that the plaintiff was actually given 
  and taken in adoption by the parents or guardians of the plaintiff as required 
  under section 11(vi). Adoption was held not to have taken place; Nemichand 
  Shantilal Patni v. Basantabai, AIR 1994 Bom 235. </section>





</article> 

  
 <article><title><number>12</number> Effects of adoption. </title>—An adopted child shall be deemed 
to be the child of his or her adoptive father or mother for all purposes with 
effect from the date of the adoption and from such date all the ties of the 
child in the family of his or her birth shall be deemed to be severed and 
replaced by those created by the adoption in the adoptive family: 
 Provided that— 
 
 <section><number>a</number> the child cannot marry any person whom he or she could not have married 
  if he or she had continued in the family of his or her birth; 
 </section><section><number>b</number> any property which vested in the adopted child before the adoption 
  shall continue to vest in such person subject to the obligations, if any, 
  attaching to the ownership of such property, including the obligation to 
  maintain relatives in the family of his or her birth; 
 </section><section><number>c</number> the adopted child shall not divest any person of any estate which 
  vested in him or her before the adoption. </section>

Where an adoption has been made with the consent of more than one wife, the 
seniormost in marriage among them shall be deemed to be the adoptive mother and 
the others to be step-mothers.
 </section><section><number>3</number>

 <article><title><number>18</number> Maintenance of wife. </title>—
<section><number>1</number> Subject to the provisions of 
this section, a Hindu wife, whether married before or after the commencement of 
this Act, shall be entitled to be maintained by her husband during her life 
time. 
 </section><section><number>2</number> A Hindu wife shall be entitled to live separately from her husband 
without forfeiting her claim to maintenance— 
 
 <subsection><number>a</number> if he is guilty of desertion, that is to say, of abandoning her without 
  reasonable cause and without her consent or against her wish, or wilfully 
  neglecting her; 
 </subsection><subsection><number>b</number> if he has treated her with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable 
  apprehension in her mind that it will be harmful or injurious to live with her 
  husband;

 </subsection><subsection><number>d</number> if he has any other wife living;

  by her without any assistance and help from the husband and there was a clear

  maintenance; Meera Nireshwalia v. Sukumar Nireshwalia, AIR 
  1994 Mad 168. 
 </subsection><subsection><number>ii</number> The thoughtless action of the husband of evicting the wife from the

  was entitled to live separately and claim maintenance; Meera Nireshwalia 
  v. Sukumar Nireshwalia, AIR 1994 Mad 168. 
 </subsection><subsection><number>iii</number> The claim for maintenance by a wife can also be sustained under 
  clause (g) even on a ground covered by one or other clauses i.e. 
  clause (a) to (f) of section 18(2) substantially but not fully. Merely 
  because the wife fails to strictly prove the specific grounds urged by her, 
  she cannot be denied relief; Meera Nireshwalia v. Sukumar 
  Nireshwalia, AIR 1994 Mad 168. </subsection></section></article>
