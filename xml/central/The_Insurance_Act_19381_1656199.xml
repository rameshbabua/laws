the Government to which the security pertains and having the same or 
approximately the same maturity, and other relevant factors;
 


             (iii)  Where

down value as per books, or the realisable value, as may be considered

cash held by the insurer whether in deposit with a bank or otherwise;
 


        (g)  the market or 
realisable value, as may be appropriate, of other assets appearing on the books
