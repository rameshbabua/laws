<footcitenum>4</footcitenum> The word' income' is of the widest amplitude and it must be 
given its natural and grammatical meaning. The definition of income 
in section 2 (24) is inclusive. The purpose of the definition is not 
to limit the meaning of' income' but to widen its net and the several 
clauses therein are not exhaustive of the meaning of income; even if a 
receipt did not fall within the ambit of any of those clauses, it 
might still be income if it partook the nature of income. The words 
" other games of any sort' were of wide amplitude and their meaning was 
not confined to mere gambling or betting activities. Assuming that 
the expression" winnings" had acquired a particular meaning viz. 
receipts from activities of a gambling or betting nature only, it did 
not follow that monies received from non- gambling or non- betting 
activities were not included within the ambit of income. The assessee 
participated in a car rally and won a prize. The car rally was a 
contest, if not a race and the assessee entered the contest to win it. 
What he got was a return for his skill and endurance. It was" income" 
construed in its widest sense. Though it was casual in nature, it was 
nevertheless income.

liability arising from contracts as well as torts. it would be 
incorrect to assume that the share of an assessee in a form consists 
only of income yielding assets. It equally comprises of risk and 
liability of paying debts on behalf of the firm. An assessee cannot, 
under the Hindu law make a declaration whereby the joint family would 
have to bear the risk and liability of the business and such a 
declaration should be ignored altogether.

 6 Where payment is made to compensate for the loss of the use of 
any goods in which the assessee does not carry on any business or the 
payment is a just equivalent of the cost incurred by the assessee, but 
excess accrues due to fortuitous circumstances or is a windfall, 
then ccrual may be a receipt, but it would not be income arising 
from business, and, therefore, not taxable under the Act.

 7 In the hands of an assessee, who maintains his accounts on the 
mercantile system, sales tax collected but not paid to the Sales Tax 
Department pending adjudication of dispute over his liability to pay 
sales tax, is a revenue receipt of the year in which it is 
collected.

 8 Where a company goes into liquidation and the liquidator 
distributes the assets of the company among the shareholders, what 
each shareholder gets is in lieu of his shareholding. That is the 
worth, the value and the price of his shareholding. A shareholder 
participates in the distribution of the assets of a company on its 
liquidation by virtue of and because of his shareholding. It is true 
that a liquidator does not sell the shares. It is equally true that 
there is no transfer of shares by the shareholder to the liquidator or 
to any other person. That is not really necessary. So long as money 
is received in lieu of shares, there is a receipt and where an 
assessee is a dealer in shares, any surplus amount received by him 
constitutes his income. The money received by the assessee in lieu of 
its shareholding partakes of the same character in which he held the 
shares. If he held the shares as stock- in- trade, the money received 
by it represents his income i. e. a revenue receipt in its hands. If 
it held them by way of investment, the money it receives 
represents a capital receipt by it.

Where a foreign agent of Indian exporter operates in his own 
country and no part of his income arises in India and his commission 
is usually remitted directly to him and is not received by him or on 
his behalf in India, the agent is not liable to income- tax in India on 
the commission.

A non- resident will not be liable to tax in India, on any income 
attributable to operations confined to purchase of goods in India for 
export even though the nonresident has an office or agency in India 
for this purpose. Where a non- resident allows an Indian customer 
facilities of extended credit for payment there would be no assessment 
merely for this reason provided that the contracts to sell were made 
outside India and the sales were made on a principal to principal 
basis.

Section 9 does not seek to bring into the tax net the profits of 
a non- resident which cannot reasonably be attributed to operations 
carried out in India. Even if there be a business connection in India 
the whole of the profit accruing or arising from the business 
connection is not deemed to accrue or arise in India. It is only that 
portion of the profit which can reasonably be attributed to the 
operations of the business carried out in India which is liable to 
income- tax.


<pagefootnote><pagenum>166</pagenum>
</pagefootnote>

 5 The mere existence of an agency, established by a non- 
resident in India, will not be sufficient to make the non- resident 
liable to tax, if the sole function of the agency is to purchase goods 
for export.

 6 Where shares in Indian companies are allotted in 
consideration for the machinery and plant, the income embedded in the 
payments would be received in India as the shares in the Indian 
companies are located in India and would accordingly attract liability 
to income- tax as income received in India.

 3 All the three limits specified in the section will operate 
as cumulative conditions and the exempt portion of the gratuity will 
be restricted to any of these three limits whichever is the least. 
Retirement gratuity will be exempt to the extent mentioned in the 
latter half of the section and the remaining amount will be entitled 
to relief under section 89 1.

In the case of gratuity funds approved for the purposes of 
Income- tax Act a provision authorising the payment of gratuity to an 
employee while he continues to remain in service should not be 
allowed. The latter half of the section should be regarded as 
covering the case of only a gratuity payment on the employee' s 
retirement or on his becoming incapacitated or on termination of his 
employment or on his death.

The rules of a fund approved for the purposes of Income tax Act 
should not permit the payment of gratuity in the form of annuities 
payable over a specified number of years.

In order to claim the exemption under the section it is necessary 
that the amount of gratuity should be calculated exactly on the basis 
laid down in the section.[ Letter No. 1 (1 79) 162, dated 13th 
December, <year>1962</year>]

 4 The expression' termination of employment used in the 
section as amended by Finance Act, <year>1972</year> covers the case of an employee 
whose services come to an end due to his resignation.

 5 Limit of exemption of death- cum- retirement gratuity under 
section 10 (10)  (iii) has been raised to Rs. 1 lakh in relation to 
employees who retire of become incapacitated or die on or after 1st 
April, <year>1988</year> or whose employment is terminated on or after that date.

capital gains arising from the transaction in acquiring the new 
capital asset, the amount of capital gains so utilised would be 
regarded as having been applied to the charitable or religious 
purposes of the trust.

 6 While under section 11 (1)  (a) the tax will be levied in the 
year to which the income relates, under section 11 (3) the income would 
be chargeable in the year in which the amounts cease to be accumulated 
for the specific purpose mentioned. Thus when amounts are taxed under 
section 11 (3) the benefit which would have been available to a trust 
in respect of 25 per cent of its income or Rs. 10, 000 under section 
11 (1)  (a) would also be lost.

 7 If a trust desires to accumulate income in excess of the 
limits specified in section 11 1 the conditions specified in section 
11 (2) have to be fulfilled in respect of the entire accumulation and 
not merely in respect of the accumulation in excess of 25 per cent of 
the income.

 5 The business income of a trust as disclosed by the accounts 
plus its other income will be the income of the trust for purposes of 
section 11 1. The trust must spend at least 75 per cent of this 
income and not accumulate more than 25 per cent thereof. Excess 
accumulation if any will become taxable under section 11 1.

 9 Donations received by a charitable trust from the members of 
the public being capital receipts cannot be regarded as income of the 
trust. Accordingly donations should be excluded from the income of 
the trust for the purpose of calculating the accumulations limit of 25 
per cent except in cases covered by section 12 (2)

 10 With a view to expediting the disposal of applications filed 
by trusts for condoning the delay, the Board had passed a general 
order under section 119 (2)  (b) by which the Commissioners have been 
authorised to admit belated applications under section 11 (2) read with 
rule 17.

gardeners, night watchman and sweepers provided by the employer should 
be calculated on an ad hoc basis as given in Letter No. 40 25 69, 
dated 8- 6- <year>1971</year> (reproduced below) only when the services of sweeper 
are provided by the employer, i. e. the sweeper is recruited by the 
employer and remunerated by him but his services are placed at the 
disposal of the employee.

 2 Rent- free accommodation.- While determining the fair rental 
value of an accommodation owned by the company, the cost of 
acquisition and other capital expenses on renovation, etc. incurred by 
the company should be taken into account. In respect of premises 
taken on lease or rent by the company the actual payment by the 
company should be taken as fair rental value of the premises.

 3 Reimbursement of medical expenses.- The value of the 
perquisite arising by way of payment or reimbursement by an employer 
of expenditure on medical treatment incurred by his employee on 
himself or on his spouse, children or parents including the provision 
of free medical treatment or treatment at a concessional rate will not 
be included in the taxable salary of the employee in the following 
cases:


</subsection>

<subsection><tid>1752984</tid>
<number>i</number>where the medical treatment is availed at hospitals, 
clinics, etc. maintained by the employer;

</subsection>

<subsection><tid>124206</tid>
<number>iv</number>where the medical treatment is availed of from any 
doctor outside the institutions schemes mentioned above, an 
expenditure of upto Rs. 10, 000 in a year in the aggregate; 
and

</subsection>

<subsection><tid>106567</tid>
<number>v</number>where the medical treatment is availed of in a hospital 
outside India and the expenditure is incurred for treatment 
including on travel and stay abroad in connection with such 
treatment, as also on travel and stay abroad of one 
attendant, to the extent permitted by RBI subject to the 
condition that the amount qualifying for such tax exemption 
would not include expenditure incurred on travel in the case 
of employees whose gross total income as computed without 
considering the amount paid or reimbursed for expenditure in 
connection with medical treatment exceeds Rs. 1 lakh.
 4 Rent- free residential accommodation.- Keeping in view the 
steep escalation in rents, it has been decided that in the case of 
rent- free accommodation provided by an employer to an employee at 
Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi and Madras, the perquisite value will be 
calculated by adding the excess over 60 per cent of the salary of the 
employee. The valuation in regard to other places in India would be 
with reference to the excess over 50 per cent. In the case of rent- 
free furnished accommodation and addition in respect of the perquisite 
by way of furniture at 10 per cent per annum of the original cost of 
such furniture is to be made.

Perquisite value of free furniture, including television sets, 
radio sets, refrigerators, other household appliances and air- 
conditioning plant and equipment provided to all categories of 
salaried taxpayers will be taken to be 15 per cent of the original 
cost of such furniture or where the furniture is hired, the hire 
charges payable by the employer.

In the case of person,,, employed by the RBI, statutory 
corporations, government companies, bodies or undertakings financed 
wholly or mainly by the government and officers of government whose 
services have been lent to or who are employed after retirement from 
Government service with any company in


<pagefootnote><pagenum>1147</pagenum>
</pagefootnote>

which not less than 40 per cent of the shares are held by the 
Government of RBI or a corporation owned by RBI, the perquisite value 
of unfurnished rent- free residential accommodation will be taken to be 
 10 per cent of the salary due to the person in respect of the period 
during which the accommodation was occupied by him.

If residential accommodation is provided by the employer at a 
concessional rent the value of the perquisite will be determined as if 
the employee had been provided with rent- free residential 
accommodation and the amount so computed will be reduced by the rent 
payable by the employee.

 5 Motor car conveyance.- If a motor car is provided by the 
employer for the use by the employee partly for his private or 
personal purpose and partly for use in the performance of his duties, 
a proportionate part of the expenditure incurred by the employer on 
the running and maintenance of the motor car and of the amount 
representing normal wear and tear of the motor car, which is 
attributable to the user of the car by the employee for his private or 
personal purposes the duties of employment are to be performed or from 
back to his residence will be regarded as use motor car for private or 
personal purposes will be taken as the value of the perquisite in the 
hands of the employee.

Where the employee is provided with or allowed the use of motor 
car for his private or personal purposes at a concessional rate, the 
value of the perquisite will first be computed as if the perquisite 
had been provided by the employer free of charge and the amount so 
computed will be reduced by the amount payable by the employee to the 
employer.

 6 Payments to servants.- The amount spent on the salary of a 
gardener by the employer does not represent a sum paid by the employer 
in respect of any obligation which but for such payment would have 
been payable by the employee. The payment of salary to a gardener as 
such cannot be regarded as a perquisite so as to justify that amount 
being taxed in the hands of' the employees. However, the expenses 
incurred by way of maintenance of a gardener may be taken into account 
for the purposes of estimating the value of rent- free residential 
accommodation provided by the employer under rule 3.

The taxable perquisite in the hands of the employee on account of 
services of servants provided by the employer will be calculated at 75 
per cent of actual wages or Rs. 60 per month whichever is less in the 
case of sweeper and 50 per cent of actual wages or Rs. 60 per month 
whichever is less in the case of gardeners and watchman.

 7 Sumptuary allowance.- Sumptuary allowance has to be treated 
as an entertainment allowance. Accordingly such allowance received by 
a person who is in receipt of salary from Government to the extent 
that such allowance is required to be deducted in computing the income 
chargeable under the head' salaries' may be regarded as an allowance 
exempt and may not be included in the term' salary' for the purposes 
of rule 3.

 8 Children' s education allowance.- Payments towards children' s 
education made to the employee or on behalf of the employee will be 
liable to income- tax (i) where fixed allowances are given in cash by 
the employer to the employee to meet the cost of education of the 
latter' s children; (ii) where the education fees are paid by the 
employer directly to the school; and (iii) where the employee incurs 
the expenses in the first instance and gets reimbursement from the 
employer.

 9 Premium for annuity.- The premium paid by an ex- employer to 
purchase an annuity payable to an ex- employee is taxable only under 
section 17 (3)  (ii). The payment will not be admissible as revenue 
expenditure in the hands of the employer.

Explanation.- Where the amount debited to the profit and loss 
account and credited to the Investment Allowance Reserve Account under 
this subsection is not less than the amount required to be so credited 
on the basis of the amount of deduction in respect of investment 
allowance claimed in the return made by the assessee under section 
139, but a higher deduction in respect of the investment allowance is 
admissible on the basis of the total income as proposed to be computed 
by the <footcitenum>3</footcitenum> Assessing] Officer under section 143, the <footcitenum>4</footcitenum> Assessing] 
Officer shall, by notice in writing in this behalf, allow the assessee 
an opportunity to credit within the time specified in the notice or 
within such further time as the <footcitenum>3</footcitenum> Assessing] Officer may allow, a 
further amount to the Investment Allowance Reserve Account out of the 
profits and gains of the previous year in which such notice is served 
on the assessee or of the immediately preceding previous year, if the 
accounts for that year have not been made up; and, if the assessee 
credits any further amount to such account within the time aforesaid, 
the amount so credited shall be deemed to have been credited to the 
Investment Allowance Reserve Account of the previous year in which the 
deduction is admissible and such amount shall not be taken into 
account in determining the adequacy of the reserve required to be 
created by the assessee in respect of the previous year in which such 
further credit is made:

Provided that such opportunity shall not be allowed by the 4 
[ Assessing] Officer in a case where the difference in the total income 
as proposed to be computed by him and the total income as returned by 
the assessee arises out of the application of the proviso to sub- 
section (1) of section 145 or sub- section (2) of that section or the 
omission by the assessee to disclose his income fully and truly.

DEPATMENTAL VIEW

 1 For the purposes of section 54E the date of transfer in cases 
where the capital assets are converted into stock- in- trade, will be 
the date on which the capital assets are converted by the assessee 
into stock- in trade and not the date on which such stock- in- trade is 
sold or otherwise transferred.[ Circular No. 560, dated 18th May, <year>1990</year>]

 2 Even in all those cases where a business is converted into a 
limited company the question of charging capital gains as well as 
gift- tax wherever provisions of the relevant Acts are found to be 
applicable, should also be considered.[ Circular No. 23D of <year>1965</year>].

 3 Exchange of gold ornaments for gold bonds would not be 
regarded as transfer of capital assets.[ Letter No. 34 11 65, dated

The relationship of employer- employee master- servant should exist 
between the assessee and the payer of the remuneration. Individuals 
who render service outside India in the capacity of independent 
contractors or consultants are not eligible for the deduction.

Seamen working as marine engineers, radio officers masters, mates, 
pursers or captains are to be regarded as technicians.

Helpers to masons who assist in concrete mixing, RCC work, etc. 
and other persons similarly placed will be regarded as technicians.

If the service is for a period not exceeding 36 months there is 
no bar to the same individual claiming the deduction in respect of any 
subsequent employment after he had served the same employer-.

Where the services outside India are performed under different 
employers the period of service under these employers cannot be 
clubbed together so as to deny the benefit of deduction- as the 
services under different employers would be under different 
agreements.

Remuneration received by seamen outside India in foreign exchange 
for services rendered outside India would qualify for the deduction.

percentage of the distributable income of the company of that previous 
year, the Income- tax Officer shall make an order in writing that the

sub- section (1) if he is satisfied-

(i) that, having regard to the losses incurred by the 
company in earlier years or to the smallness of the profits 
made in the previous year, the payment of a dividend or a 
larger- dividend than that declared within the period of 
twelve months referred to in sub- section (1) would be

(ii) that the payment of a dividend or a larger dividend 
than that declared within the period of twelve months 
referred to in sub- section (1) would not have resulted in a 
benefit to the revenue; or

(iii) that at least seventy- five per cent of the share 
capital of the company is throughout the previous year

distributable income, but in the assessment made by the 
Income- tax Officer under section 143 or section 144 a higher 
total income is arrived at and the difference in the total 
income does not arise out of the application of the proviso 
to sub- section (1) of section 145 or sub- section (2) of 
section 145 or section 144 or the omission by, the company to 
disclose its income fully and truly; or

(iv) in the case of a company where a reassessment is made

under sub- section (1) or sub- section (2) or, as the case may be, sub- 
section (3), if, by reason of the current income being likely to be 
greater than the income on which the advance tax so payable by him has 
been computed or for any other reason, the amount of advance tax 
computed in the manner laid down in section 209 on the current income 
 (which shall be estimated by the assessee) exceeds the amount of 
advance tax so payable by him by more than 33 1 3 per cent of the 
latter amount, he shall, on or before the date on which the last 
instalment of advance tax is payable by him, send to the Income- tax 
Officer an estimate

(i) the current income, and

(ii) the advance tax payable by him on the current income calculated 
in the manner laid down in section 209,

and shall pay such amount of advance tax as accords with his estimate 
on such of the dates applicable in his case under section 211 as have 
not expired, by instalments which may be revised according to sub- 
section (5):

Provided that in a case where the Commissioner is satisfied that, 
having regard to the nature of the business carried on by the assessee 
and the date of expiry of the previous year in respect of such 
business, it will be difficult for the assessee to furnish the 
estimate required to be furnished by him in accordance with the 
provisions of this sub- section on or before the date on which the last 
instalment of advance tax is due in his case, he may, if the assessee 
pays the advance tax which he is liable to pay under subsection (1) or 
sub- section (2) or, as the case may be, sub- section (3) on or before 
such date, extend the date for furnishing such estimate up to a period 
of thirty days immediately following the last date of the previous 
year in respect of that business and, where the date is so extended, 
the assessee shall pay, on or before the date as so extended, the 
amount by which the advance tax already paid by him falls short of the 
advance tax payable in accordance with his estimate:

thirty days immediately following the last date of the previous year 
in respect of that business, and where the date is so extended, the 
assessee shall pay, on or before the date as so extended, the amount 
by which the amount of advance tax already paid by him falls short of 
the advance tax payable in accordance with his estimate:

Provided further that in the case of an assessee, being a 
company, the provisions of this sub- section shall have effect as if 
for the figures and words' 331 3 per cent', the figures and words 20 
per cent' had been substituted.

(4) Every estimate under this section shall be sent in the

case may be. The scope of enquiry, whether by the High Court or 
before the Supreme Court, remains the same, viz., to consider whether 
the order of the Settlement Commission is contrary to the provisions 
of the Income- tax Act, and if so, whether it has prejudiced the 
petitioner. This is, of course apart from grounds of bias, fraud and 
malice which constitute a separate and independent category. Where, 
in a case before the Settlement Commission, the Commission has to 
interpret a trust deed, even if the interpretation placed by 
Commission on the trust deed is not correct, it would not be a ground 
for interference by the Supreme Court in an appeal from the order of 
the Settlement Commission made under section 245D, since a wrong 
interpretation of a deed of trust cannot be said to be a violation of 
the provisions of the Income- tax Act. It is equally clear that the 
interpretation placed upon the deed by the Commission does not bind 
the incometax authorities in proceedings relating to other assessment 
years not covered by the order. Jyotendrasinghji v Tripathi (SI)
