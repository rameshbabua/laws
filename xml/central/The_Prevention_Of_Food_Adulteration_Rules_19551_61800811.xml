Flavouring agents.—Flavouring agents include flavour substances, flavour 
extracts or flavour preparations, which are capable of imparting flavouring 
properties, namely taste or odour or both to food. Flavouring agents may be of 
following three types:—
 <section>
<number>A</number> Natural-flavours 
and Natural Flavouring Substances 
 
“Natural flavours” and 
“Natural flavouring substances” are flavour preparations and single substance 
respectively, acceptable for human consumption, obtained exclusively by physical 
processes from vegetable 

2[***] for human 
consumption.
 </section><section>
<number>B</number> Nature-identical 
Flavouring Substances 
 
Nature-identical 
flavouring substances are substances chemically isolated from aromatic raw 
materials or obtained synthetically ; they are chemically identical to 
substances present in natural products intended for human consumption, either 
processed or not.
 </section><section>
<number>C</number> Artificial 
Flavouring Substances 
 
Artificial flavouring
