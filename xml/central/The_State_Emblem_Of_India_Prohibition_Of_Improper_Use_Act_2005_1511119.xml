The 
    State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper Use) Act, 2005
 

 
 

 
 



    The Schedule
 


[See
    section 2(b)]
 



State Emblem of India
 


Description 
    and Design
 


The State Emblem of India is an adaptation 
    from the Sarnath Lion Capital of Asoka which is preserved in the Sarnath 
    Museum. The Lion Capital has four lions mounted back to back on a circular 
    abacus. The frieze of the abacus is adorned with sculptures in high relief 
    of an elephant, a galloping horse, a bull and a lion separated by 
    intervening Dharma Chakras. The abacus rests on a bell-shaped lotus.  
 


The profile of the Lion Capital showing three 
    lions mounted on the abacus with a Dharma Chakra in the centre, a bull on 
    the right and a galloping horse on the left, and outlines of Dharma Chakras 
    on the extreme right and left has been adopted as the State Emblem of India. 
    The Bell-shaped lotus has been omitted.  
 


The motto Satyameva JayateTruth alone 
    triumphswritten in Devanagari script below the profile of the Lion Capital 
    is part of the State Emblem of India.  
 


The State Emblem of India shall conform to the 
    designs as set out in Appendix I or Appendix II.
