The Saarc Convention (Suppression of 
    Terrorism)  

    Act, 1993
 

 
 

 
 



The Schedule
 


[See section 2(a)]
 



Saarc Regional 
    Convention on Suppression of Terrorism
 


The Member States of the 
    South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)
 



Mindful 
    of the principles of cooperation enshrined in the
    saarc Charter;
 


Recalling that at the 
    Dhaka Summit on December 7-8, 1985, the Heads of State or Government of the 
    member States of the SAARC recognised the seriousness of the problem of 
    terrorism as it affects the security and stability of the region;
 



Also recalling 
    the Bangalore Summit Declaration of 17th November, 1986, in which the Heads 
    of State or Government of SAARC agreed that cooperation among SAARC States 
    was vital if terrorism was to be prevented and eliminated from the region; 
    unequivocally condemned all acts, methods and practices of terrorism as 
    criminal and deplored their impact on life and property, socio-economic 
    development, political stability, regional and international peace and 
    cooperation; and recognised the importance of the principles laid down in UN 
    Resolution 262 (XXV) which among others required that each State should 
    refrain from organising, instigating, assisting or participating in acts of 
    civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organised 
    activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such 
    acts;
 


Aware of the danger posed 
    by the spread of terrorism and its harmful effect on peace, cooperation, 
    friendship and good neighbourly relations and which could also jeopardise 
    the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States;
 



Have resolved 
    to take effective measures to ensure that perpetrators of terroristic acts 
    do not escape prosecution and punishment by providing for their extradition 
    or prosecution, and to this end;
 


Have agreed as follows:—
 

 
 


Article I
 


Subject to the overall 
    requirements of the law of extradition, conduct constituting any of the 
    following offences according to the law of the Contracting State, shall be 
    regarded as terroristic and for the purpose of extradition shall not be 
    regarded as a political offence or as an offence connected with a political 
    offence or as an offence inspired by political motives:—
 


(a)  
    an offence within the scope of the Convention for the Suppression of 
    Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, signed at the Hague, on December 16, 1970;
 


(b)  
    an offence within the scope of the Convention for the Suppression of 
    Unlawful Act, against the Safety of Civil Aviations signed at Montreal, on 
    September 23, 1971;
 


(c)  
    an offence within the scope of the Convention on the Prevention and 
    Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including 
    Diplomatic Agents, signed at New York, on December 14, 1973;
 


(d)  
    an offence within the scope of any Convention to which the SAARC member 
    States concerned are parties and which obliges the parties to prosecute or 
    grant extradition;
 


(e)  
    murder, manslaughter, assault causing bodily harm, kidnapping, 
    hostage-taking and offences relating to firearms, weapons, explosives and 
    dangerous substances when used as a means to perpetrate indiscriminate 
    violence involving death or serious bodily injury to persons or serious 
    damage to property;
 


(f)  
    an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offence described in sub-paragraphs 
    (a) to (e), aiding, abetting or counselling the commission of such an 
    offence or participating as an accomplice in the offences so described.
 

 
 


Article II
 


For the purpose of 
    extradition between SAARC member States, any two or more Contracting States 
    may, by agreement, decide to include any other serious offence involving 
    violence, which shall not be regarded as a political offence or an offence 
    connected with a political offence or an offence inspired by political 
    motives.
 

 
 


Article III tc 
    "Article III" 
 


1. The provisions of all 
    extradition treaties and arrangements applicable between Contracting States 
    are hereby amended as between Contracting States to the extent that they are 
    incompatible with this Convention.
 


2. For the purpose of 
    this Convention and to the extent that any offence referred to in Article I 
    or agreed to in terms of Article II is not listed as an extractable offence 
    in any extradition treaty existing between Contracting States, it shall be 
    deemed to be included as such therein.
 


3. Contracting States 
    undertake to include these offences as extractable offences in any future 
    extradition treaty to be concluded between them.
 


4. If a Contracting State 
    which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a 
    request for extradition from another Contracting State with which it has no 
    extradition treaty, the requested State may, at its option, consider this 
    Convention as the basis for extradition in respect of the offences set forth 
    in Article I or agreed to in terms of Article II. Extradition shall be 
    subject to the law of the requested State.
 


5. Contracting States 
    which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty, 
    shall recognise the offences set forth in Article I or agreed to in terms of 
    Article II as extraditable offences between themselves, subject to the law 
    of the requested State.
 

 
 


Article IV tc 
    "Article IV" 
 


A Contracting State in 
    whose territory a person suspected of having committed an offence referred 
    to in Article I or agreed to in terms of Article II is found and which has 
    received a request for extradition from another Contracting State, shall, if 
    it does not extradite that person, submit the case without exception and 
    without delay, to its competent authorities, so that prosecution may be 
    considered. These authorities shall take their decisions in the same manner 
    as in the case of any offence of a serious nature under the law of that 
    State.
 

 
 


Article V tc 
    "Article V" 
 


For the purpose of 
    Article IV, each Contracting State may take such measures as it deems 
    appropriate, consistent with its national laws, subject to reciprocity, to 
    exercise its jurisdiction in the case of an offence under Article I or 
    agreed to in terms of Article II.
 

 
 


Article VI tc 
    "Article VI" 
 


A Contracting State in 
    whose territory an alleged offender is found, shall, upon receiving a 
    request for extradition from another Contracting State, take appropriate 
    measures, subject to its national laws, so as to ensure his presence for 
    purposes of extradition or prosecution. Such measures shall immediately be 
    notified to the requesting State.
 

 
 


Article VII tc 
    "Article VII" 
 


Contracting States shall 
    not be obliged to extradite, if it appears to the requested State that by 
    reason of the trivial nature of the case or by reason of the request for the 
    surrender or return of a fugitive offender not being made in good faith or 
    in the interests of justice or for any other reason it is unjust or 
    inexpedient to surrender or return the fugitive offender.
 

 
 


Article VIII tc 
    "Article VIII" 
 


1. Contracting States 
    shall, subject to their national laws, afford one another the greatest 
    measure of mutual assistance in connection with proceedings brought in 
    respect of the offences referred to in Article I or agreed to in terms of 
    Article II, including the supply of all evidence at their disposal necessary 
    for the proceedings.
 


2. Contracting States 
    shall cooperate among themselves, to the extent permitted by their national 
    laws, through consultations between appropriate agencies, exchange of 
    information, intelligence and expertise and such other cooperative measures 
    as may be appropriate, with a view to preventing terroristic activities 
    through precautionary measures.
 

 
 


Article IX tc 
    "Article IX" 
 


1. The Convention shall 
    be open for signature by the member States of SAARC at the SAARC Secretariat 
    in Kathmandu.
 


2. It shall be subject to 
    ratification. Instruments of Ratification shall be deposited with the 
    Secretary-General of SAARC.

    "Article X"
