alternation, he and the contractor whom he employs to carry out the erection, 
addition or alteration, shall if such work, building, structure, flood bank, 
road or additions and alterations, thereto, would, during or after the 
construction result in contravention of any of the provisions of rule 77, 79 or

and shall furnish therewith a scale drawing showing the proposed building, 
structure, flood bank road, any addition or alteration and scaffolding required 
during the con­struction.
 </section><section>
<number>2</number> 
(a) On receipt of the notice referred to in sub-rule (1) or otherwise, the 
supplier shall examine whether the line under reference was lawfully laid and 
whether the person was liable to pay the cost of alteration and if so, send a 
notice without undue delay, to such person together with an estimate of the cost 
of the expenditure likely to be incurred to so alter the overhead line and 
require him to deposit, within 30 days of the receipt of the notice with the 
supplier, the amount of the estimated cost.

contravened either during or after the aforesaid construction:
 

Provided that the Inspector may, if he is satisfied that the overhead line has 
been so guarded as to secure the protection of persons or property from injury,

overhead line or in the case of temporary addition or alteration, without 
alteration of the overhead line.

In the absence of an agreement to the contrary between the parties concerned, 
the cost of such alteration of the overhead line laid down shall be estimated on 
the following basis, namely:—
