8[***];

with the rules made thereunder or with any other statutory provisions.

any matter, suspend the permit 1 [***]. 
 

(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the power in sub-paragraph (1), 
the Director-General may cancel or suspend the permit for such period as he 
thinks fit, if he is satisfied— 
 
 

(a) that any of the conditions of the permit has not been complied with and 
  the failure is due to any wilful act or default on the part of the holder of 
  the permit or by any of his servants, or agents irrespective of whether or not 
  such wilful act or default of the servant or agent was with the knowledge or 
  approval of the holder of the permit; or 
 

(b) that the holder of the permit has failed to establish a safe, efficient 
  and reliable service; or 
 

(c) that having regard to the financial resources of the holder of the 
  permit or the losses incurred by him, he cannot be relied upon to continue the 
  operation of the service in a safe, efficient and reliable manner; or 
 

(d) that such substantial changes have taken place in regard to the matters

permit or of the appointment of a receiver, manager or trustee, in relation to 
the business of the holder, the person for the time being carrying on that 
business shall, if he makes an application within 14 days of the said event to 
the Director-General for a new permit, be entitled to continue the operation of 
the scheduled air transport service until the application is disposed of, or 
unless the Director-General has directed otherwise in the interest of public 
convenience. 
 

19. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as conferring upon the holder 
of a permit on its expiry any right to the issue of a new permit for the 
operation of a service on the same route or to the continuance of any other 
benefits under this Schedule: 
 

Provided, however, that if the holder of a permit applies for a new permit to 
continue the operation for a further period and if the Director-General is 
satisfied that the scheduled air transport service has been operated efficiently 
and in the best interests of the public and that the Corporations or their 
associates do not propose to operate on the route, the Director-General shall 
give preference to the holder of the permit. 
 

20. (1) The permit shall be kept at the principal office of the holder 
thereof and shall be produced for inspection on demand by any Magistrate, any 
Police Officer not below the rank of a Deputy Superintendent of Police, any

permit is suspended by the Director-General, the holder shall surrender the 
permit to the Director-General for cancellation or endorsement as the case may 
be. 
 

21. The holder of a permit shall perform such services for the conveyance of 
mails (with or without officers of the post office in charge thereof) on a 
scheduled air transport service as the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs 
may from time to time require. The remuneration for any service performed in 
pursuance of such requirement shall be such as may be agreed to between the 
holder of the permit and the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs, and in 
the event of disagreement between them, as may be determined by the Central 
Government upon a reference made to it by either of them. 
 

22. Every person to whom a permit has been granted under this Schedule shall 
submit to the Director-General in such form as may be prescribed by him:—
