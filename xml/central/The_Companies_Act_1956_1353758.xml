it appears to the Central Government desirable for a holding company 
or a holding company' s subsidiary, to extend its financial year so 
that the subsidiary' s financial year may end with that of the holding 
company, and for that purpose to postpone the submission of the 
relevant accounts to a general meeting, the Central Government may, on 
the application or with the consent of the Board of directors of the 
company whose financial year is to be extended, direct that in the 
case of that company, the submission of accounts to a general meeting, 
the holding of an annual general meeting or the making of an annual 
return, shall not be required to be submitted, held or made, earlier 
than the dates specified in the direction, notwithstanding anything to 
the contrary in this Act or in any other Act for the time being in 
force.

section (1) if it is necessary so to do, in order to secure that the 
end of the financial year of the subsidiary does not precede the end 
of the holding company' s financial year by more than six months, where 
that is not the case at the commencement of this Act, or at the date 
on which the relationship of holding company and subsidiary comes into
