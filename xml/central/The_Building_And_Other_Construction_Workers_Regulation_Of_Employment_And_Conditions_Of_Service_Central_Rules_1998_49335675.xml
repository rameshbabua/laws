Explanation.— 
For the purpose of this rule, thorough examination means a visual examination, 
supplemented, if necessary, by other means such as hammer test, carried out as 
carefully as the conditions permit, in order to arrive at a reliable conclusion 
as to the safety of the parts examined; and if necessary, for such examination, 
parts of the lifting appliance and gear, shall be dismantled.

   25                                                     (1.22 x safe working 
   load) + 20
 


(b) In the case of a single 
sheave block, the safe working load shall be the maximum load which can safely 
be listed by the block when suspended by its head fitting and the load is 
attached to a rope which passes around the sheave of the block and a test load 
not less than four times the proposed safe working load shall be applied to the 
head of the block.
 


(c) In the case of a multi 
sheave block, the test load shall be less than the load as specified in the 
following table:—
 


Table
 


 


      Safe working load (in tonnes)                     
   Test load (in tonnes)
 


      Up to 
25                                                  2 x safe working load
 


      25 to 
160                                                (0.9933 x safe working load) 
+ 27
 


 


      above 160                                               
   1.1 x safe working load

hand-operated pulley blocks used with pitched chains and rings, hooks, shackles 
or swivels, permanently attached thereto, a test load not less than 50 per cent 
in excess of the safe working load shall be applied.
 


(e) In the case of a pulley 
block fitted with a bucket, the bucket shall be tested and the load applied to 
the bucket when testing that block will be accepted as test load of the bucket.
 


(f) In the case of a sling 
having two legs, the safe working load shall be calculated when the angle 
between the legs is 90 degree. In case of multi-legged slings the safe working 
load shall be calculated as per national standards.
 


(g) Every lifting beam, 
lifting frame, container spreader, bucket, tub, or other similar devices shall

   3
 


(i) Before any test is 
carried out, a visual inspection of the lifting appliance, or lifting gear 
involved shall be conducted and any visible defective gear shall be replaced or 
renewed.
 


(j) After being tested, all 
the lifting gears shall be examined to see whether any parts have been injured 
or permanently deformed by the test.
 


Procedure for testing:
 


(3) Derricks.—(a) A 
derrick shall be tested with its boom at the minimum angle to the horizontal 
for which the derrick is designed (generally 15 degrees) or at such greater 
angle as may be agreed. The angle at which the test has been carried out shall 
be mentioned in the test certificate. The test load shall be applied by 
hoisting moveable weights. During the test, the boom shall be swung with the 
test load, as far as practicable, in both directions.
 


(b) A derrick boom, designed 
to be raised with power, with the load suspended, shall, in addition to the 
tests at (a), be raised (with the load suspended) to its maximum working angle 
to the horizontal and the two outermost positions.
 


(c) While test loading of a 
heavy lift derrick, the competent person responsible for tests using moveable 
weights shall ascertain from the owner of the vessel or floating platform that 
the stability of the vessel or platform is adequate for the test.
 


(4) The derricks tested 
under clause (3) shall not be used in union purchase rig unless:
 


      (a) the derricks rigged 
in union purchase are tested with the test load appropriate to the SWL in Union 
purchase (at the designed headroom and with the derrick booms in their approved 
working positions);
 


      (b) the safe working 
load of that derrick in union purchase rig has also been specified by a 
competent person in a report in Form V;
 


      (c) any limitation or 
conditions specified in the said report are complied with; and 
 


      (d) the two hoist ropes 
are coupled together by a suitable swivel assembly.
 


Note.—The 
safe working loads of derricks (for each method of rig including union 
purchase) shall be shown on the Certificate of Test and marked on the derrick 
booms.
 


(5) Lifting appliances.—(a) 
The test load shall be lifted and swung, as far as possible, in both 
directions. If the jib or boom of the crane has a variable radius, it shall be 
tested with test loads at the maximum and minimum radii. In case of hydraulic 
cranes when owing to the limitation of pressure, it is impossible to lift a 
test load in accordance with table under item (1), it will be sufficient to 
lift the greatest possible load which shall be more than safe working load.
 


(b) The test shall be 
performed at maximum, minimum and intermediate radius points as well as such 
points in the arc of rotation, as the competent person may decide. The test 
shall consist of hoisting, lowering, breaking and swinging and swinging through 
all positions and operations normally performed. An additional test shall be 
made by operating the machinery at maximum working speed with the safe working 
load suspended.
 


(6) Use of spring or hydraulic balances, etc. for test 
loading.—All tests shall normally be carried on with the help of dead 
weights. In case of periodical test, replacements or renewals, test load may be 
applied by means of suitable springs or hydraulic balances. In such case, test 
load shall be applied with the boom, as far out as practicable, in both 
directions. The test shall not be taken as satisfactory unless the balance has 
been certified for accuracy by the competent authority within 2.0 per cent and 
the pointer of the machine has remained constant at the test load for a period 
of at least five minutes.
 


(7) Testing machines and dead weights.—(a) A suitable 
testing machine shall be used for testing of chains, wire ropes and other 
lifting gears.
 


(b) Testing machines and balances to be used in test loading, 
testing and checking shall not be used unless they have been certified for 
accuracy at least once in the preceding twelve months by the competent 
authority.
 


(c) Movable weights used for the test loading of the lifting 
appliances having a safe working load not exceeding twenty tonnes shall be 
checked for accuracy by means of suitable weighing machine of certified 
accuracy.
 


(8) Thorough examination after testing or test loading.—After 
being tested or test loaded, every lifting appliance and associated gear shall 
be thoroughly examined to see that no part has been damaged or permanently 
deformed during the test. For this purpose, the lifting appliance or gear shall 
be dismantled to the extent considered necessary by the competent person.
