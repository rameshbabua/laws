    General principles to be followed in administration of Act.-The 
    Central Government, the State Governments, the Food Authority and other 
    agencies, as the case may be, while implementing the provisions of this Act 
    shall be guided by the following principles, namely:-  
 <section>
<number>1</number> (a)    endeavour to achieve an 
    appropriate level of protection of human life and health and the protection 
    of consumers' interests, including fair practices in all kinds of food trade 
    with reference to food safety standards and practices;  
 <subsection>
<number>b</number>    carry out risk management which 
    shall include taking into account the results of risk assessment, and other 
    factors which in the opinion of the Food Authority are relevant to the 
    matter under consideration and where the conditions are relevant, in order 
    to achieve the general objectives of regulations;  
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>c</number>    where in any specific 
    circumstances, on the basis of assessment of available information, the 
    possibility of harmful effects on health is identified but scientific 
    uncertainty persists, provisional risk management measures necessary to 
    ensure appropriate level of health protection may be adopted, pending 
    further scientific information for a more comprehensive risk assessment;  
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>d</number>    the measures adopted on the basis 
    of clause (c) shall be proportionate and no more restrictive of trade than 
    is required to achieve appropriate level of health protection, regard being 
    had to technical and economic feasibility and other factors regarded as 
    reasonable and proper in the matter under consideration;  
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>e</number>    the measures adopted shall be 
    reviewed within a reasonable period of time, depending on the nature of the 
    risk to life or health being identified and the type of scientific 
    information needed to clarify the scientific uncertainty and to conduct a 
    more comprehensive risk assessment;  
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>f</number>    in cases where there are 
    reasonable grounds to suspect that a food may present a risk for human 
    health, then, depending on the nature, seriousness and extent of that risk, 
    the Food Authority and the Commissioner of Food Safety shall take 
    appropriate steps to inform the general public of the nature of the risk to 
    health, identifying to the fullest extent possible the food or type of food, 
    the risk that it may present, and the measures which are taken or about to 
    be taken to prevent, reduce or eliminate that risk; and  
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>g</number>    where any food which fails to 
    comply with food safety requirements is part of a batch, lot or consignment 
    of food of the same class or description, it shall be presumed until the 
    contrary is proved, that all of the food in that batch, lot or consignment 
    fails to comply with those requirements.  
 </subsection></section><section>
<number>2</number> The 
    Food Authority shall, while framing regulations or specifying standards 
    under this Act-  
 <subsection>
<number>a</number>    take into account-  
 <subsubsection>
<number>i</number>    prevalent practices and 
    conditions in the country including agricultural practices and handling,

 </subsubsection><subsubsection>
<number>ii</number>    international standards and 
    practices, where international standards or practices exist or are in the 
    process of being formulated,  
 
unless it is of opinion that taking into 
    account of such prevalent practices and conditions or international 
    standards or practices or any particular part thereof would not be an 
    effective or appropriate means for securing the objectives of such 
    regulations or where there is a scientific justification or where they would 
    result in a different level of protection from the one determined as 
    appropriate in the country;  
 </subsubsection></subsection><subsection>
<number>b</number>    determine food standards on the 
    basis of risk analysis except where it is of opinion that such analysis is 
    not appropriate to the circumstances or the nature of the case;  
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>c</number>    undertake risk assessment based 
    on the available scientific evidence and in an independent, objective and 
    transparent manner;  
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>d</number>    ensure that there is open and 
    transparent public consultation, directly or through representative bodies 
    including all levels of panchayats, during the preparation, evaluation and 
    revision of regulations, except where it is of opinion that there is an 
    urgency concerning food safety or public health to make or amend the 
    regulations in which case such consultation may be dispensed with:  
 
Provided that such regulations shall be 
    in force for not more than six months.  
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>e</number>    ensure protection of the 
    interests of consumers and shall provide a basis for consumers to make 
    informed choices in relation to the foods they consume,  
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>f</number>    ensure prevention of-
