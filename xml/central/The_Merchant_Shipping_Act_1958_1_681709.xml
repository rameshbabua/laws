desertion in proceedings for forfeiture of wages.—
<section><number>1</number> 
Whenever a question arises whether the wages of any seaman or apprentice are 
forfeited for desertion from a ship, it shall be sufficient for the person 
insisting on the forfeiture to show that the seaman or apprentice was duly 
engaged in or belonged to the ship, and either that he left the ship before the 
completion of the voyage or engagement or, if the voyage was to terminate in 
India and the ship has not returned, that he is absent from her and that an 
entry of his desertion has been duly made in the official log book.
 </section><section><number>2</number> The desertion shall 
thereupon, so far as relates to any forfeiture of wages under this Part, be 
deemed to be proved, unless the seaman or apprentice can produce a proper 
certificate of discharge or can otherwise show to the satisfaction of the court 
that he had sufficient reasons for leaving his ship.

master or the owner of the ship, and subject to that reimbursement, shall be 
paid to the Central Government.
 </section><section><number>2</number> For the purposes of such 
reimbursement the master or the owner or his agent may, if the wages are earned 
subsequent to the desertion, recover them in the same manner as the deserter 
could have recovered them if not forfeited; and the court in any legal 
proceeding relating to such wages may order them to be paid accordingly.

the manner prescribed, to the court of survey for the port where the ship is 
detained.
 </subsection><subsection>        <number>e</number>   Where a ship has been provisionally detained 
and a person has been appointed under this section to survey such ship, the 
owner or master of the ship, at any time before such person makes that survey,

master may select, being a person named in the list of assessors for the court 
of survey or, if there is no such list, or if it is impracticable to procure the 
attendance of any person named in such list, a person of nautical engineering or 
other special skill and experience. If the surveyor and assessor agree that the 
ship should be detained or released, the Central Government shall cause the ship

satisfied that a ship detained under this section is not unsafe, order her to be 
released either upon or without any conditions.
 </subsection></section><section><number>2</number> Any person appointed by the 
Central Government for the purpose (in this Act referred to as a detaining 
officer) shall have the same power as the Central Government has under this 
section of provisionally ordering the detention of a ship for the purpose of 
being surveyed, and of appointing a person to survey her, and if he thinks that 
a ship so detained by him is not unsafe, may order her to be released.
 </section><section><number>3</number> A detaining officer shall forthwith report to the Central

as hereinafter mentioned:
 Provided that, where the 
complaint is made by one-fourth, being not less than three, of the seamen 
belonging to the ship, and is not in the opinion of the Central Government or 
the detaining officer frivolous or vexatious, such security shall not be 
required, and the Central Government or the detaining officer shall, if the 
complaint is made in sufficient time before the sailing of the ship, take proper 
steps to ascertain whether the ship ought to be detained under this Part.

other than Indian ships of provisions as to detention.—When 
a ship other than an Indian ship is in a port in India and is, whilst at that 
port, unsafe by reason of the defective condition of her hull, equipment or 
machinery, or by reason of overloading or improper loading, the provisions of 
this Part with respect to the detention of ships shall apply to that ship as if 
she were an Indian ship with the following modifications, namely:—
 <section>        <number>a</number>   a copy of the order for the provisional 
detention of the ship shall forthwith be served on the consular officer for the

is detained;
 </section><section>        <number>b</number>   the consular officer, at the request of the 
owner or master of the ship, may require that the person appointed by the 
Central Government to survey the ship shall be accompanied by such person as the 
consular officer may select, and in that case, if the surveyor and that person 
agree, the Central Government shall cause the ship, to be detained or released 
accordingly, but, if they differ, the Central Government may act as if the 
requisition had not been made, and the owner and master shall have the like 
right of appeal to a court of survey touching the report of the surveyor as is 
hereinbefore provided in the case of an Indian ship; and
