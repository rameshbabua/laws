      protect the interests of the Board and, may apportion the costs of the 
      proceedings in such manner as it thinks fit:
 
 Provided further that unless the Board intimates 
      the court that it will not appeal against any order releasing any property 
      from attachment, such order shall not be given effect to until the expiry 
      of the period fixed under sub-section (12) within which an appeal may be 
      preferred, or if an appeal is preferred, unless the court empowered to 
      hear appeals from the decisions of the said court otherwise directs, until 
      the appeal is disposed of.
 
 </subsection></section><section><number>10</number> An order of attachment or sale of property 
      shall be carried into effect, as far as may be practicable, in the manner

      of the order, appeal to the court empowered to hear appeals from the 
      decisions of the court which passed the order and the appellate court may, 
      after hearing the parties, pass such orders as it thinks proper.
 
 </section><section><number>13</number> Nothing in this section shall be construed, 
      where proceedings for liquidation or in insolvency in respect of the oil 
      industrial concern or other person have commenced before an application is 
      made under sub-section (1) as giving to the Board any preference over the 
      other creditors of the concern or other person not conferred on it by any 
      other law.
 
 </section><section><number>14</number> For the removal of doubts, it is hereby 
      declared that any court competent to grant an ad interim injunction
