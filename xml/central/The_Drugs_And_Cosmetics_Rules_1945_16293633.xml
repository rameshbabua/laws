such a use may cause blindness.”
 
Each package shall also 
contain instructions in English and local languages on the following lines for 
carrying out the test:—
 
              “This preparation may cause 
serious inflammation of the skin in some cases and so a preliminary test should 
always be carried out to determine whether or not special sensitivity exists. To 
make the test, cleanse a small area of skin behind the ear or upon the inner 
surface of the forearm, using either soap and water or alcohol. Apply a small 
quantity of the hair dye as prepared for use to the area and allow it to dry. 
After twenty-four hours, wash the area gently with soap and water. If no 
irritation or inflammation is apparent, it may be assumed that no 
hypersensitivity to the dye exists. The test should, however, be carried out 
before each and every application. This preparation should on no account be used 
for dyeing eyebrows or eyelashes as severe inflammation of the eye or even 
blindness may result.”

1[SCHEDULE F (1)
 


PART I
 




VACCINES
 


(A) PROVISIONS 
APPLICABLE TO THE PRODUCTION OF BACTERIAL VACCINES
 


1. Definition—(1) 
This part of the Schedule applies to bacterial vaccines made from any 
micro-organism pathogenic to man or other animal and to vaccines made from other 
micro-organism pathogenic to man or other animal and to vaccines made from other 
micro-organisms which have antigenic value.
 


(2) For the purposes of 
this part of the Schedule, a bacterial vaccine means a sterile suspension of a 
killed culture of the micro-organism from which the vaccine derives its name or 
sterile extract or derivative of a micro-organism, or a pure suspension of 
living micro-organisms which have been previously made avirulent.
 


2. Staff of 
Establishment—A 
competent expert in bacteriology with sufficient experience in the manufacture 
and standardisation of biological products shall be in charge of the 
establishment responsible for the production of bacterial vaccine and he shall 
be assisted by a staff adequate for carrying out the tests required during the 
preparation and standardisation of the vaccines.
 


3.   Proper Name—The 
proper name of the vaccine shall be the name of the micro-organism from which it 
is made followed by the word “Vaccine” unless this Schedule otherwise provides 
or if there is no other special provision in this Schedule, some other name as 
approved by the licensing authority: Provided that in the case of the 
under-mentioned preparations the proper name of the vaccine may be as follows:—
 


         1.  Anthrax Spore 
Vaccine (Living).         
 


         2.  Blackquarter 
Vaccine.
 


         3.  Enterotoxaemia 
Vaccine.
 


         4.  Fowl Cholera 
Vaccine.
 


         5.  Haemorrhagic 
Septicaemia Adjuvant Vaccine.
 


         6.  Haemorrhagic 
Septicaemia Vaccine (Broth).
 



         2[7.  Multi 
Component Clostridial Vaccine.
 


         8.  Haemorrhagic 
Septicaemia Vaccine—Alum treated.]
 


4. Records—Cultures 
used in the preparation of vaccine before being manipulated into a vaccine, 
should be thoroughly tested for identity by the generally accepted tests 
applicable to the particular micro-organisms.
 


The permanent records which 
the licensee is required to keep shall include amongst others, a record of the 
origin, properties and characteristics of the cultures.
 


5. Combined Vaccines—Vaccines 
may be issued either singly or combined in any proportion in the same container. 
In the case of combination of vaccines, a name for the combined vaccine may be 
submitted by the licensee to the licensing authority, and if approved, may be 
used as the proper name of the vaccine.
 


6. Preparation—Bacterial 
vaccines, simple or polyvalent, are prepared from selected cultures after 
careful examination for their identity, specificity, purity and antigenicity. 
They may be prepared in the following manner:—
 


        (a)  Formal 
Cultures or Bacterins.—The selected pure culture stain or strain are grown 
in a suitable fluid medium, at an optimum temperature, for an appropriate 
period. The pure growth is then exposed to the action of solution of 
Formaldehyde I.P. in suitable concentration and temperature. The product is 
finally filled in suitable sterilised containers which are subsequently sealed.
 


        (b)  Vaccine of 
Bacterial Products or Bacterial Derivatives—These vaccines are prepared by 
growing the organisms on suitable media and then deriving specific antigenic 
constituents of the bacteria by various special methods.
 


        (c)  Living 
Bacterial Vaccines—They are prepared from non-pathogenic but fully 
immunogenic strains of micro-organism. Strict aseptic precautions are taken 
throughout the preparation against the introduction of microbial contaminants.
 


7. General Standards—
 


        (a)  
Description—Bacterial vaccines are colourless to yellowish brown liquids 
containing dead or viable bacteria in homogeneous suspension.
 


        (b)  
Identification—All types of vaccines confer active immunity in the 
susceptible animals which can be demonstrated by injecting suitable experimental 
animals with the calculated doses of the product and subsequently determining 
the presence of the protective antibodies in their serum and/or by challenging 
the vaccinated animals by injecting virulent strain of the homologous organisms. 
The protected animals should survive the challenge.
 


        (c)  Tests for 
Sterility—All bacterial vaccines shall be tested for sterility in accordance 
with the provision of Rules 115 to 119 (both inclusive). If the vaccine contains 
added bactericide or bacteriostatic, a quantity of medium sufficient to render 
the growth inhibitor ineffective is added to the sample, or a suitable substance 
is added to the sample, or a suitable substance is added in a concentration 
sufficient to render the growth inhibitor ineffective but not itself to inhibit 
the growth of micro-organism.
 


        (d)  Purity 
Tests for Living Bacterial Vaccine—Petri-dishes containing suitable media 
are streaked with the final product and incubated at 370C 
for 72 hours. The vaccine passes the test if no growth of micro-organisms other 
than those from which the vaccine was prepared is observed. Other tests include 
examination for motility of the organisms, fermentation reactions and 
thermoagglutination test and dye-inhibitor test in case of bruceliza vaccine.
 


        (e)  Safety Test—The 
safety of the vaccine shall be assessed by injecting it in appropriate dose in 
suitable susceptible animals. No animal should show any untoward, general or 
local reaction, within seven days after inoculation.
 


         (f)  Potency 
Test—Wherever applicable, susceptible experimental animals are inoculated 
with the calculated doses of the final product. The animals are challenged, 
after the period of immunisation, with virulent infective dose of the homologous 
culture along with the controls. The potency of the vaccine is assessed by the 
survival of the vaccinated animals and the death of the controls.
 


8. Labelling—
 


        (a)  The label on 
the ampoule or the bottle shall indicate:
 


              (i)  Proper 
name.
 


             (ii)  Contents 
in millilitres or doses.
 


            (iii)  Potency,

ANTHRAX SPORE VACCINE 
(LIVING)
 


1. Synonyms—A 
virulent Anthrax Spore Vaccine or Bacillus Anthracis Vaccine (Living).
 


2. Definition—The 
vaccine is a suspension of living spores of an uncapsulated avirulent strain of 
B. anthracis in 50 per cent glycerine saline.
 


3. Preparation—Avirulent 
B. anthracis of known antigenicity is grown on suitable medium at pH 7.4 in Roux 
flasks. After 72 hours incubation at 370C, 
the pure sporulated culture growth which shows 70 to 80 per cent sporulation is 
washed with normal saline and glycerinated to the extent of 50 per cent by 
weight of the culture washing and the whole suspension is kept at room 
temperature for twenty-one days to allow for the stabilization of the spores.
 


4. Standards—
 


        (a)  Description—It 
is slightly opalescent or pale brown semi-viscous liquid.
 


        (b)  
Identification—Uncapsulated B. anthracis which is avirulent can be isolated 
from the vaccine.
 


        (c)  Sterility 
Test—Should comply with the test for sterility described in the general 
monograph on “Bacterial Vaccine”.
 


        (d)  Purity Test—Complies 
with the “Purity Tests for Living Bacterial Vaccine” described under the general 
monograph on “Bacterial Vaccine”.
 


        (e)  Safety Test—Four 
healthy adult guinea-pigs each weighing 300-450 g. not previously treated with 
any material which will interfere with the test are inoculated subcutaneously, 
two with 0.2 ml. each and two with 0.5 ml. each of the unglycerinated suspension 
respectively. Four more guinea pigs are injected with 1:5 dilution of the 
glycerinated product in the same manner. Not untoward reaction should be

13[FOOT AND 
MOUTH DISEASE VACCINE (INACTIVATED)
 


1. Synonym—Inactivated 
Tissue culture mono or polyvalent Food and Mouth Disease Vaccine.
 


2. Definition—Foot 
and Mouth Disease Vaccine is a liquid product or preparation containing one or 
more types of foot and mouth disease virus which have been inactivated in such a 
way that its immunogenic property is maintained. It may also contain an 
adjuvant. The vaccine is described as monovalent, bivalent, trivalent or 
polyvalent depending on the number of types of virus used.
 


3. Preparation—The 
virus is propagated in suitable cell culture. The cell culture is infected with 
an appropriate inoculum of virus and incubated at a suitable temperature for 
multiplication of virus. The virus is harvested and cellular debris removed by 
filteration. Inactivation is carried out by a suitable agent such as 
formaldehyde solution or an aziridine compound. The adjuvant may be aluminium 
hydroxide and/or saponin. In case of inactivated gel vaccine the antigen is 
concentrated by sedimentation at plus 4 degree C. For preparing a polyvalent 
vaccine, monovalent antigens are mixed in appropriate quantities to give the 
final mixture which is the formulated vaccine.
 


4. Standards—
 


        (a)  
Description— Aluminium hydroxide gel vaccines settle down to variable degree 
on storage leaving the supernatant clear.
 


        (b)  
Identification—It protects cattle against Food and Mouth Disease due to 
homologous type/sub-type of virus.
 


        (c)  Sterility 
test—It shall comply with the tests for sterility as prescribed under the 
general monograph of “viral vaccines”.
 


        (d)  Safety 
test—The test is carried out on fully susceptible cattle not less than 12 
months of age and which have not been sensitized either by vaccination or 
previous infection. Inoculate 3 susceptible cattles each with 2 ml. of finished 
product at multiple sites on tongue by intradermal route and observe for 4 days. 
The same animals are inoculated on 4th day with 3 cattle doses subcutaneously 
and are observed for a further period of 6 days. The animals should not develop 
any signs of FMD and remain normal.
 


        (e)  Potency 
test—Each batch of the vaccine is to be tested in susceptible cattle of not 
less than 15 months of age. The potency test in cattle can be done either by:
 


              (i)  PD50 method—The 
vaccine shall be tested by the determination of PD50 in 
susceptible cattle by challenging animals vaccinated with appropriate dilution 
of the vaccine made in adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted diluent as appropriate.
 


                   A 
minimum of 5 animals should be used per dilution and 2 unvaccinated animals to 
be included as controls to the challenge. All animals are needle challenged with 
10,000 ID50 of 
the homologous strain of virus by inoculation on the tongue on the 21st day of 
post-vaccination.
 


                   The 
control animals are to be similarly challenged. Animals are observed for 10 days 
for the development of lesions. Unprotected animals shows generalised lesions 
due to FMD. Control animals must show generalised lesions, from the number of 
animals protected in each group the PD50 content 
of the vaccine is calculated. The vaccine passes the test if an observed PD50 value 
of 3 or greater is obtained in the test.
 


             (ii)  
Percentage protection method in which groups of ten healthy susceptible cattle 
are each injected subcutaneously with the vaccinating dose and 14—21 days later 
the cattle are challenged by intradermal injection into three separate sites on 
the tongue with 10,000 ID50 of 
the strain of virus used in the preparation of the vaccine. The vaccine can be 
passed if at least seven out of the ten in the group are protected against the 
development of generalised infection whereas all the controls should react by 
developing primary and secondary lesions observable in the mouth and feet.
 


For other reasons and if 
cattle testing is not possible then the potency of the vaccine may be assessed 
in guinea pigs either by Lucam ‘C’ index or PD50 method 
by challenging those which have been previously vaccinated, provided that a 
correlation has been established between guinea pig challenge test and cattle 
challenge results.
 


The estimation of serum 
neutralizing antibody titre in cattle may be considered as a supportive test to 
evaluate potency of vaccine.
 


However, potency testing of 
vaccines in cattle, of batches whenever by other accepted methods of testing is 
in doubt, at least one out of every five batches, be undertaken.
 


5. Labelling—It 
is labelled as described under the requirements of ‘Labelling’ as laid down in 
the general monograph, with the additional requirements that the label on the 
container states the virus types used in the preparation.
 


6. Storage—It 
should be protected from light and stored between 4oC 
to 8oC. 
Under these conditions it may be expected to retain its potency for not less 
than 12 months. Freezing of aluminium hydroxide vaccine must be avoided. The 
frozen product will not be fit for use.

at least 25 chickens each at one day of age shall be used. These chickens shall 
be of the same source and batch, be susceptible to Marek’ disease and be kept in 
isolated group.
 


              Group I: Each 
Chicken shall be injected with 0.2 ml. of 10 times as much viable virus as will 
be contained in one dose of vaccine by intramuscular route.
 


              Group II:

virulent Marek’s disease virus, with the other 30 non-vaccinated control chicks. 
At the end of the observation period when the chicks are 20 weeks old, the 
surviving chickens are examined for the presence of antibody against Marek’s 
disease by serological tests and post-mortem inspection for lesions of Marek’s 
disease.
 


Any bird dead is thoroughly 
examined and the cause of death ascertained by necropsy/histopathological 
examination. All the surviving birds are killed and necropsied. The protection 
index (PI) is determined by following procedure:
 



                                                      No. with MD lesions
 


1. Per cent MD = x 100
 


                  No with 
MD lesions + No of -ve Survivours (effective No.)
 


                  Per cent 
MD in controls - Per cent MD in vaccinated
 


2. P.I. = 
——————————————————————————————— x 100
 



                                                      Per cent MD in controls
 


Master seed virus should 
have P.I. of the least 80 per cent.
 


Eighty per cent of the 
chicks in the control group must fall ill specifically. If more than 80 per cent 
of the vaccinated chickens do not show symptoms or signs of Marek’s disease, the 
seed virus is regarded as sufficiently effective and can be used for production 
of vaccine.
 


The seed virus is 
propagated in duck embryo fibro-blast cell culture, chick embryo fibroblast or 
any other suitable cell culture (specific pathogen free SPF flock) and when the 
peak passage level is attained the cell monolayer is suspended in cold diluent 
of the following composition.

0.1 ml. on CAM and 0.1 ml in alantoic sac). Embryonated eggs shall be candled 
for 7 days daily. Deaths occurring in the first 24 hours shall be discarded. 
CAMS of embryos which die after 24 hours shall be examined. When necessary 
embryo sub-culture shall be made to determine the cause of death. The test 
should be concluded on the 7th day cost inoculation.
 


The surviving embryos and 
their CAMS are examined. If deaths or abnormality due to the inoculum occur, the 
seed virus is unsatisfactory.
 


Immunogenicity test—Thirteen 
susceptible dogs 8-14 weeks old, shall be used for the test (ten vaccinates and 
3 controls). Blood samples are drawn from these animals and individual sample is 
tested for antibodies against canine distemper. The dogs shall be injected with 
a predetermined quantity of the virus and remaining 3 dogs are used as 
unvaccinated controls. The dose shall be based on the virus titration. At least 
21 days post infection the vaccinated and controls shall be challenged 
intramuscularly with the same dose of virulent canine distemper virus and the 
animals observed each day for 21 days. At least 2 out of 3 controls should die 
and survivor should show the symptoms typical of canine distemper. At least 9 
out of 10 vaccinated animals should survive and should not show any clinical 
signs of canine distemper during the observation period. The stock seed virus 
should be tested for immunogenicity at least once in 5 years, if maintained 
under suitable conditions of storage. Eight days old chicken embryos from a 
healthy flock are inoculated on their chorioallantoic membrane with 
bacteriologically sterile virus suspension of egg adapted strain. After 
incubation for a period of five days, infected membrane and embryos are 
harvested. The individual embryo is tested for bacterial sterility. Those free 
from bacterial contamination are made into a 20 per cent suspension in a 
suitable medium. The suspension is distributed in a single dose quantity into 
the ampoules or vials and freeze dried.
 


The ampoules are sealed 
under vacuum or with pure dry sterile nitrogen before sealing. Alternatively, 
the virus may be grown on the suitable cell culture. Cells along with the 
suspending fluid is harvested, distributed in single dose quantity in ampoules 
and freeze dried.

shall be inoculated intraperitoneally with 0.5 ml. Both groups shall be observed 
for 7 days, if unfavourable reaction attributable to the product in either 2 or 
more mice in either group is observed during observation period, the batch is 
unsatisfactory.
 


             (ii)  Dog 
Safety test—Inject two healthy dogs, eight to fourteen weeks old that have 
previously been shown to be free from distemper virus-neutralising antibodies by 
the recommended route with twice the dose stated on the label and observe for 21 
days. No significant local or general reaction develops.
 


                     (i) 
Potency test— (i) Titration: Final samples of finished product shall be 
tested for virus titre, and when tested at any time within the expiry period, it

in embryonated hen’s eggs of cultivated in cell culture.
 


3. Preparation—Only 
stock seed virus which has been established as pure, safe and immunogenic shall 
be used. Each lot of stock seed virus shall be tested for other pathogens by 
chicken embryo inoculation tests as follows:—
 


A lot of seed virus shall 
be mixed with 9 volumes of sterile, heat-inactivated specific antiserum to 
neutralise and the vaccine virus serum mixture shall be inoculated into each of 
at least 20 fully susceptible chicken embryos of 9-11 days old (0.1 ml. on CAM 
and 0.1 ml. in the allantoic sac). Eggs are candled daily for 7 days. Death 
occurring during first 24 hours shall be discarded but at least 18 viable 
embryos shall survive 24 hours post inoculation for a valid test. All embryo and 
CAMS from embryos shall be examined which die after 24 hours. If necessary 
embryo subcultures shall be made to determine the cause of death. The test shall 
be concluded on the 7th day post inoculation and surviving embryos including the 
CAM shall be examined. If death or abnormality to the stock seed virus occur, 
the seed lot is unsatisfactory.
 


Each lot of stock seed 
virus shall be tested for immunogenicity as below:—
 


Bronchitis susceptible 
chickens of the same age and source shall be used. For each method of 
administration recommended on the label and for each serotype against which 
protection is claimed, 20 chicks shall be used as vaccinates. Ten additional 
chickens for each serotype against which protection is claimed shall be held as 
unvaccinated controls. 21 to 28 days post vaccination all vaccinates and 
controls shall be challenged by eye drops with virulent Bronchitis virus. A 
separate set of vaccinates and controls shall be used for each serotype against 
which protection is claimed. The challenge virus shall have a titre of at least 
104.6 EID50 per 
ml. Trachea swabs shall be taken once 5 days post challenge from each vaccinates 
and controls. Each swab shall be placed in test tube containing 3 ml. of 
tryptose phosphate broth and antibiotics. The tubes and swabs shall be swirled 
thoroughly and stored at minus 40oC 
pending egg inoculation. For each chicken swabs at least 5 chicken embryos, 9-11 
days old shall be inoculated in the allantoic cavity with 0.2 ml. of broth from 
each tube. All the embroys surviving 3rd day post inoculation shall be used in 
evaluation. A tracheal swab shall be positive for virus recovery when any of the 
embryos show typical infectious bronchitis virus lesions such as stunting, 
curling, kidney urates, clubbed down or death during 4-7 days post inoculation 
period.
 


Ninety per cent of the 
controls should prove positive for virus recovery. If less than 90 per cent of 
the controls are negative for virus recovery, the stock seed is unsatisfactory. 
The stock seed virus should be tested for immunogenicity once in 5 years 
provided it is maintained under standard conditions of the bronchitis virus 
storage.

products into buffalo-bulls or other suitable animals so as to produce active 
immunity which is manifested by the formation of anti-body.
 


(ii) For the purpose of 
this part of the Schedule an antiserum means sterile liquid antiserum 
concentrated and unconcentrated, solutions of globulins or their derivatives or 
solid forms which can be reconstituted when necessary.

establishment shall be under the direction and control of a competent expert in 
bacteriology and serology with adequate training in immunology and 
standardisation of biological products and knowledge of animal management. He 
shall be assisted by a staff adequate for carrying out the tests required during 
the course of preparation of the sera and standardisation of the finished 
products.
 


3. Proper Name—The 
proper name of the antiserum shall be the recognised scientific name of the 
disease or its causative organism or some generally recognised abbreviations 
thereof preceded by the prefix ‘anti’, and followed by the word ‘serum’ as for 
example, ‘Anti-anthrax serum’. The proper name of any antitoxin may be formed 
from the word ‘Anti-toxin’ preceded by the name of the organism from which the 
toxin was prepared, and followed, if desired, by a term indicating the source of 
the strain of that organism provided where there is no special provision in the 
Schedule, the name as approved by the licensing authority may be adopted.
 


4. Records—(1) 
The permanent records which the licensee is required to keep shall include the 
following particulars:—
 


        (a)  As to the 
cultures—Evidence of the identity and specificity of the cultures.
 


        (b)  As to the 
procedure used in immunising the animals:
 


              (i)  The 
method of preparing the cultures or antigen used for immunisation.
 


             (ii)  The 
dosage and methods employed in administering the culture or antigen.
 


            (iii)  The 
period in the course of immunisation at which blood is withdrawn for the 
preparation of the serum.
 


        (c)  Any test which 
may have been applied to the serum to determine its content of specific 
antibodies or its specific therapeutic potency and purity.
 


(2) If the licensee desired 
to treat the performance of any tests recorded under sub-paragraph (i) (c) of 
this paragraph as determining the date of completion of manufacture for the 
purpose of Rule 109 he shall submit full particulars of the proposed test to the 
licensing authority and obtain his approval.
 


5. Cultures—The 
cultures used in immunising the animals shall be at all times open to 
inspection, and specimens shall be furnished for examination at the request of 
the licensing authority.
 


6. Quantity—(a) 
Any antiserum shall be issued for veterinary use in the form of either—
 


         (i)  Actual serum, 
i.e., the liquid product of decantation of the coagulated blood or plasma 
without any addition, other than antiseptic or subtraction, or
 


        (ii)  A solution of 
the purified serum proteins containing the specific antibodies.
 


(b) At the time of issue, 
the liquid shall be clear or show at the most a slight opalescence or 
precipitate. Preparations of the natural serum shall not contain more than 10 
per cent of solid matter. A solution of serum protein shall not contain more 
than 20 per cent of solid matter.
 


7. Precautions to be 
observed in preparation.—(i) 
Laboratories where sera are exposed to the air in the course of the process of 
preparation must be separated by a sufficient distance from stables and animal 
houses to avoid the risk of aerial contamination with bacteria from animal 
excreta, and must be rendered fly-proof to prevent such contamination by 
insects. Such laboratories must have impervious walls and floors and must 
capable of being readily disinfected when necessary.
 


        (ii) A special room 
with impervious walls must be provided for the collection of blood from the 
living animals.
 


        (iii) An efficient 
system of manure removal must be used which will prevent its accumulation in the 
vicinity of any room where blood or serum is collected or handled.
 


       (iv)  An adequate 
number of sterilizers must be provided for the sterilization of all glassware or 
other apparatus with which the serum may come into contact in the course of its 
preparation.
 


        (v) All processes 
to which the serum is subjected during and after the collection from the 
animals, must be designed to preserve its sterility, but in the case of an 
artificially concentrated sera it shall suffice that the process of 
concentration is conducted with scrupulous cleanliness and in such a manner as 
to avoid unnecessary dangerous contamination.
 


       (vi) The 
laboratories in which the testing of sera for potency, sterility and freedom 
from abnormal toxicity are carried out must be adequate for the purpose. An 
adequate supply of animals for use in such tests and suitable housing for such 
animals must be provided.
 


       (vii) Provision must 
be made for complying with any special conditions which may be laid down in the 
Schedule relating to the production and issue of the particular serum, in 
respect of which the licence is granted.
 


8. Unhealthy or Infected 
Animals—If an 
animal used in the production of sera is found to be suffering from an infection 
except one produced by living organisms against which it is being immunized, or 
shows sign of serious or persistent ill health not reasonably attributable to 
the process of immunisation, the licensee shall immediately report the matter to 
the licensing authority and shall, if the authority orders an inspection and the 
Inspector so directs, cause such animal to be killed and a post mortem 
examination of it to be made, and take steps to prevent any serum obtained from 
the animal being sold or offered for sale until permission is given by the 
licensing authority. If the result of the post-mortem is such as to bring under 
suspicion, the health of any of the other animals used for the production of 
sera, the licensing authority may prohibit the use of those animals for the 
production of sera or may take such other steps as may be necessary to prevent 
the issue of sera which may be dangerous to animal health:
 


Provided in the case of 
emergency, the person is charge of the establishment may order the destruction 
of an animal used in the production of sera and suspected of infection, and 
shall in that case give notice forthwith to the licensing authority and shall 
permit an Inspector to be present at the post mortem examination.
 


9. Conditions and 
Housing of Animals—(i) 
The animals used in the production of sera should be adequately housed under 
hygienic environments.
 


(ii) Only healthy animals 
free from disease should be used in the preparation of sera.
 


(iii) Every animal intended 
to be used as the source of serum must be subjected to a period of observation 
in quarantine for at least seven days before being admitted to the animal sheds 
in which the serum-yielding animals are housed.
 


(iv) In case of horses and 
other equidae, every animal used as source of serum shall either be actively 
immunized against tetanus or shall be passively immunized against the disease by 
injection of tetanus antitoxin in such doses as to ensure the constant presence 
of that antitoxin in the blood during the whole period of the use of the animal 
as a source of serum.
 


ANTI-SERA AND THEIR 
GENERAL STANDARD
 


Anti-sera contain the 
immune substances that have a specific prophylactic or therapeutic action when 
injected into animals exposed to or suffering from a disease due to specific 
micro-organism or its toxin. Anti-sera are classified into three groups:
 


         (i)  Antitoxic 
sera (Antitoxin)
 


        (ii)  Antibacterial 
sera.
 


        (iii)  Antiviral 
sera.
 


Anti-sera are usually 
issued in an unconcentrated form for animal use but may be concentrated and also 
freeze dried. However, for the purpose of the Schedule the word ‘anti-sera is 
also used for the unconcentrated liquid sera only. A suitable bacteriostatic 
agent in a concentration sufficient to prevent the growth of micro-organisms is 
added to the liquid serum.
 


GENERAL STANDARD
 


1. Description—Liquid 
native or unconcentrated anti-sera are yellow or yellowish brown in colour. They 
are initially transparent but may become turbid with age. They are almost 
odourless except for the odour of any bacteriostatic agent that may have been 
added.

ml. of the sample and observed for five days. None of the mice should show any 
abnormal reaction or die.
 


        (b)  Two healthy 
guinea pigs each weighing 300 g. to 450 g. are injected subcutaneously each with 
5 ml. of the sample and observed for seven days. None of the guinea pigs should 
show any abnormal reaction or die.
 


5. Sterility—All 
anti-sera shall comply with the tests for sterility described in Rules 115 to 
119.
 


6. Potency—The 
potency of each preparation, when the available methods permit, is determined by 
the appropriate biological assay, and it is described under the individual 
monograph.

ABORTUS BANG RING 
(ABR.) ANTIGEN
 


1. Synonym—Milk 
Ring Test Antigen.
 


2. Definition—The 
antigen is a suspension of pure growth culture of standard strain of Brucella 
abortus strain 99 strained supravitally with 2, 3, 5, triphenyl tetrazolium 
chloride suspended in 0.85 per cent saline containing 1 per cent glycerol and 1 
per cent phenol.
 


3. Preparation—Smooth 
strain of Brucella abortus strain 99 is grown on potato infusion agar for 
48 to 72 hours in Roux flasks, at 37oC. 
Condensation fluid if any is pipetted off before washing. Each flask is washed 
with about 20 ml. of normal saline. The pooled washing is filtered through a 
gauze and the filtrate is collected in a measuring cylinder. To every 500 ml. of 
the filtrate 1g. of 2, 3, 5, triphenyl tetrazolium chloride is added 
immediately. The container is shaken for thirty minutes till the tetrazolium 
salt is dissolved. The product is taken out and kept in at 37oC 
for two hours. After incubation the product is heated at 65oC 
in a water bath for thirty minutes. It is cooled and centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m 
for one hour. The supernatant is pipetted off and sediment is suspended in 
normal saline containing 1 per cent glycerol and 1 per cent phenol and filtered 
through sterile cotton wool. This forms concentrated antigen.
 


STANDARDIZATION OF 
THE STRAINED ANTIGEN
 


An aliquot portion of the 
microbial suspension stained with phenyltetrazolium is taken, representing the 
initial undiluted suspension. 1 ml. per tube of this initial undiluted stained 
suspension is added to six test tubes, followed by increasing quantities of the 
glycerolphenol diluent as follows:—
 


 


Undiluted Stained 
  Suspension
 


 


  
  Tube                                                                                                         
  Diluent
 


     
1                                                          
1                                                   0.6
 


     
2                                                          
1                                                   0.8
 


     
3                                                          
1                                                   1.0
 


     
4                                                          
1                                                   1.2
 


     
5                                                          
1                                                   1.4
 


 


     
  6                                                          
  1                                                   1.6
 


The contents of each tube 
are then diluted tenfold with the same diluent and serve as antigen for a tube 
agglutination test with the Standard Serum (or its national counterpart). In 
this way, six seroreactions will be carried out. During this procedure, the 
concentrated strained microbial suspension should be kept in the refrigerator at 
4oC.
 


The agglutination reactions 
are read after forty-eight hours at the agglutination titre of the Standard 
Serum, previously determined with the usual unstained antigen in the test tube, 
corresponds to the correct dilution of the standard antigen.
 


The next step, therefore, 
is to dilute the concentrated stained suspension to the same extent as the tube 
whose tenfold dilution has given the correct agglutination titre i.e., 
the concentration of antigen in the tube before the tenfold dilution had been 
made.

strain of S. Pullorum is grown on sulphur agar medium in Roux flasks for 
five days at 37oC. 
The pure growth is washed with 1.0 per cent Formol Saline.
 


Standardisation
 


The antigenic cells 
suspension is then centrifuged (preferably in cold centrifuge) for half an hour 
at 4000 rotations per minute and the packed cell volume determined. The packed 
cell is then resuspended in a solution containing 1 per cent formalin, 1 per 
cent. KH2PO4
and 0.85 per cent 
sodium chloride, 1 ml. of packed cell is suspended in 10 ml. of the 
resuspendiary solution, mixed thoroughly and is passed through a cotton wool 
pad. The turbidity of the antigenic suspension is usually between 100 to 125 
times Mac Farland scale standard and optimum 3 cc. of a 1 per cent aqueous 
solution of crystal violet are added to 100 ml. of the antigenic suspension. 
After making the dye the antigen is allowed to stand forty-eight hours before 
use. The average yield per Roux flask of culture medium is about 50 ml. The 
antigen should be bottled in 10 ml. or 20 ml. quantity in amber-coloured bottles 
and corked with rubber caps and paraffin sealed and preserved until required for 
use within the expiry period. This antigen reacts instantly with the blood of 
all carrier birds and remains permanently negative with that of non-infected 
birds.
 


This antigen gives good 
reactions with positive sera whose titre is even as low as 1: 20.
 


4. Standards—
 


        (a)  
Description—Violet coloured liquid containing dead bacteria in suspension.
 


        (b)  
Identification—It gives specific agglutination when mixed with the serum of 
birds infected with S. Pullorum infection. It is used for carrying out plate 
agglutination test for serological diagnosis for S. Pullorum infection in 
birds.
 


        (c)  Sterility 
Test—Should comply with the test for sterility described in the general 
monograph of ‘Diagnostic Antigens.’ The test shall be done before addition of 
‘Crystal violet’.
 


5. Labelling and Storage— 
Should comply with the requirements of ‘Labelling’ and `Storage’ as laid down in 
the general monograph on ‘Diagnostic Antigens’.
 


6. Expiry Date—A

TUBERCULINE
 


(i) Tuberculines are 
preparations of fluid media on which Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been grown 
in artificial culture and which has been freed by filtration from the bacilli.
 


(ii) For the purposes of 
the Schedule tuberculines are classified in (a) Tuberculine-Subcutaneous (b) 
Heat concentrated synthetic Medium (H.C.S.M.) Tuberculine (c) Avian tuberculine.
 


2. Preparation—(a)
Tuberculine subcutaneous—Flasks containing Henley and Dorset synthetic 
medium are inoculated with standard human strains of Myco. Tuberculosis 
previously grown on glycerol-beef broth medium for ten days. After ten to twelve 
weeks of incubation at 37oC 
flasks containing pure growth are steamed for three hours. The contents are 
filtered through fine meshed sieve and the volume is made up to its original 
with phenolised distilled water such that the final concentration of phenol is 
0.5 per cent. It is then filtered through Seitz filter.
 


(b) Heat Concentrated 
Synthetic Medium (H.C.S.M.) Tuberculine—To the strained liquid obtained 
after sieving as in the method of preparation of tuberculine subcutaneous, 
glycerol is added in the proportion of 122 ml. per litre of the original volume 
of medium used. The mixture is evaporated to one-fifth of the original volume on 
a steam bath. An equal volume of 1 per cent phenol in distilled water is added 
after the mixture is cooled. The product is stored at 47oC 
for fourteen days before it is filtered through Seitz filter. It is then 
dispensed in ampoules.
 


(c) Avian Tuberculine 
Concentrated—The procedure is the same as for Tuberculine Concentrated (H.C.S.M.) 
except that standard strain of Mycotuberculosis (Avian) is used in its 
preparation.
 


3. Standards—
 


        (a)  
Description—A yellowish brown viscous liquid.
 


        (b)  
Identification—When injected intradermally into the animal infected with 
tuberculosis diffused swelling occurs depending upon the allergic status of the 
animal, the magnitude of dose and specificity of the product. In non-infected 
animals this reaction is not observed.
 


        (c)  Sterility 
Test—Should comply with the test for sterility described in the general 
monograph on ‘Diagnostic Antigens’.
 


        (d)  Potency 
Test—(i) Tuberculine subcutaneous—Six large white guinea-pigs each 
weighing not less than 300-450 g. are individually inoculated intramuscularly 
with 0.5 mg. (moist growth from solid plants) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
three weeks prior to test of each batch of tuberculine: the following dilutions 
of (a) test tuberculine and (b) standard tuberculine are used:—
 


                  1 in 200, 
1 in 400, 1 in 800, 1 in 1000.
 


                  The six 
sensitized guinea pigs are depilated on one flank and after about twenty-four 
hours each animal inoculated intradermally with 0.2 ml. of each dilution of the 
two tuberculines in two rows. The reactions are read after twenty-four and forty 
eight hours. When the local reactions produced by the graded inter-dermal 
injections of the two preparations are comparable the brew is passed for issue.
 


        (ii)  Heat 
Concentrated Synthetic Medium (H.C.S.M.) Tuberculine—Six adult white guinea 
pigs each weighing not less than 300-450 g. and sensitized three weeks 
previously with 0.5 mg. (moist growth from solid plants) of Myco-Tuberculosis 
bovine type, injected intramuscularly are used for test of each batch. The 
following dilutions of (a) test tuberculine and (b) standard tuberculine are 
used:—
 


                  1 in 500, 
1 in 1000, 1 in 2000 and 1 in 4000.
 


                  The six 
sensitized guinea pigs are depilated on one flank and after twenty-four hours 
each animal is inoculated intradermally with 0.2 ml. of each dilution of the two 
tuberculines in two rows. The reactions are read after twenty four and forty 
eight hours. When the local reaction produced by the graded intradermic 
injections of the two preparations are comparable, the test tuberculine is 
passed for issue. The tuberculine is dispensed in ampoules.
 


        (iii)  Avian 
Tuberculine—Six adult fowls, with well developed wattles, sensitized at 
least three weeks previously by intramuscular injection with 10 mg. moist weight 
(from solid plants) of twenty one days old culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
(Avian Type) are used for potency test of each batch. In each fowl, one wattle 
is inoculated with 0.2 ml. of undiluted test tuberculine and the other wattle 
with similar quantity of undiluted standard tuberculine. The reactions in each 
fowl are read after twenty four hours and forty eight hours and if comparable 
the product is passed for issue.
 


5. Labelling and Storage— 
Should comply with the requirements of ‘Labelling’ and `Storage’ as laid down in 
the general monograph on ‘Diagnostic Antigens’.
 


6. Expiry Date—The 
date of expiry of potency shall be not more than two years from the date of 
manufacture when stored at 2oC 
to 4oC.

conditions protected from moisture and dust.
 


METHODS OF TEST
 


Defect in fabric—The 
sample is unfolded, opened and held against diffused daylight or spread on black 
topped table to locate and identify prominently visible defect in yarn and 
fabric construction. The fabric shall be reasonably free from holes, slubs, 
snarls and naps as well as the following:—
 


Odour—Misty 
odour, or any objectionable smell like that of chemicals or materials used in 
sizing and bleaching.
 


Skewness—(For 
Bandage Cloth only). A condition where warp and weft do not keep at right angles 
to each other.
 


Defective selvedge—The 
selvedge tearing and allowing yarn to unravel, and loop formation at selvedge.
 


Crack—Prominent 
streaks of space or gaps between warp or weft yarns.
 


Double ends—More 
warp threads woven as one, due to wrong draw.
 


Sloughing—Entanglement 
in the fabric of a bulk of yarn that has slipped off the weft yarn due to loose 
widing.
 


Measurement to length 
and width—Length 
is the distance from end to end, along one edge of the fabric, and width is the 
perpendicular distance from one edge to the opposite edge.
 


Length—Fix 
a metre scale to a table or mark off the division of one metre on a table edge. 
Starting from one end, spread the fabric flat on that table in a single layer 
keeping one selvedge parallel to the scale; smoothen the fabric without 
stretching it, to avoid creases, and mark off with a coloured pencil, on the 
selvedge exactly one metre. Shift the fabric and measure in the same way the 
second metre and so on for the entire length of the fabric making a mark at each 
metre. Note down the total length in metres. Repeat this at the opposite 
selvedge, as well as on the fabric folded approximately about middle. The 
average of the three readings is the length. For cut bandages, one measurement 
at the middle of the bandage by folding it length-wise will suffice.
 


Width—Lay 
the portion of the fabric to be measured flat and smooth on table, but do not 
stretch fabric except sufficiently to render it creaseless. At the place where 
mark had been made on the selvedge in measuring the length measure the 
perpendicular distance to the opposite selvedge with a metre scale. Note the 
width, repeat this at every mark made in measuring the length. The average of 
all the readings is the width of the fabric. For cut bandages, width shall be 
measured at every 50 cm., and average reported as width.
 


Threads per dm—(For 
samples not less than 15 m. in Length.)
 


Weft—At 
the third metre from one extreme locate three places one at about 5 cm. below 
the top selvedge, a second in the middle and third at about 5 cm. above the 
bottom selvedge, all three in a vertical row. Take a rectangular plate (made of 
suitable material such as plastic or aluminium) with the rectangular opening of 
5 cm. x 10 cm. cut in it. Keep the plate on the fabric horizontally so that the 
left 5 cm. side and bottom (10 cm. side) edges of the opening coincides with a 
weft and warp yarn respectively; count the number of weft yarns within the 
opening for the length of 10 cm. Repeat this at the other two selected places, 
and note down the average of three readings. Repeat this at every third metre in 
the sample and calculate the average weft per dm.
 


Warp—Keep 
the rectangular plate, this time vertically with left (10 cm. side) and bottom 
(5 cm. side) edge of opening coinciding with a weft and warp yarn respectively. 
Count the number of warp yarns within the opening for 10 cm. and note down. 
Repeat this for about 10 selected places in the samples taking care that the 
same set of warp yarns is not counted more than twice and calculate the average 
warp per dm. Magnifying glass mounted on stand may be used for counting.
 


For samples less than 15 m. 
in length, locate as many different places as the dimension of the fabric 
permits, the total being not less than 10 for each sample, and calculate the 
warp and weft per dm. as above.
 


For cut bandages, all the 
warp threads in the samples are counted, taking care to leave 5 mm. at the cut 
edge, and weft is counted at every 50 cm. at any place about the middle of the 
bandage.
 


Weight per unit area—For 
samples not less than 15 m. in length, cut out pieces of fabric from the entire 
length of the sample, representative places being taken from areas at every 
third or fourth metre so that the total area of all the pieces so collected is 
not less than 3 sq. metre. Weight the pieces accurately, measure the dimension 
of each of the pieces and calculate the area and weight of all the pieces. From 
the average area and average of weight thus obtained, calculate the area per sq. 
metre.
 


For samples less than 15 m. 
in length, take pieces in such manner that the total area of the selected pieces 
is not less than 20 per cent of the total area of the sample.
 


For cut bandages, pieces of 
50 cm. in length, cut from 5 different cut bandages in a packing should be taken 
and weight calculated as an average of 5 readings.
 


Absorbency—Take 
a glass trough of approximate size length 30 cm. x width 30 cm x depth 25 cm. 
with straight thick walls and flat bottom. Fill it almost full with distilled 
water leaving only about 5 cm. from the top rim of trough. Maintain the water at 
27oC
 + 1oC.
 


Cut out from any five 
places located equidistant down the length of the entire sample, square pieces, 
each weighing one gm. ( + 10 per cent). For each piece in such a manner 
that a square of approximately 5 cm. x 5 cm. is obtained. Keep one of the folded 
test specimen between two glass plates and place 1 kg. weight on the top for 10 
minutes. Remove the weight. Lift the specimen with forceps and gently place it 
on the surface of water (the specimen should be lightly pinched in the middle 
with the blunt forceps having no serrations). As soon as the specimen touches 
the water surface start a stop watch which is stopped when the entire sample 
disappears below the surface of the water. Record the time taken. Repeat the 
test with the other four-test specimens. Calculate the average time in seconds.
 


Foreign Matter—Dry 
about 5 g. of the sample to constant weight at 105oC 
and weight the dried sample accurately. Extract the dried sample with chloroform 
for one hour in an apparatus for the continuous extraction of drugs. Remove the 
extracted sample to a beaker and allow the evaporation of residual chloroform. 
Wash the material 12 times with hot water, using about 1000 ml. for each washing 
and wringing the material by hand after each washing; pass all water through a 
fine sieve (100 mesh.). Place the washed material and any loose threads or 
fibres from the sieve in a beaker, cover with a 0.5 per cent aqueous solution of 
diastase and maintain at 50oC 
until free from starch. Allow to cool, filter the solution through a sieve; 
return sample and loose fibres to a beaker. Repeat the washing process as before 
with hot water. Dry the material to constant weight at 105oC, 
and determine the loss in weight. Calculate the percentage of foreign matter, 
which is equal to the loss in weight, with reference to the sample dried to 
constant weight, at 105oC.
 


If the sample is tested 
with iodine and is known to be free from starch, the treatment with solution of 
diastase and the second series of washing with hot water may be omitted.
 


Cloth for manufacture of 
Plaster of Paris Bandages, cut and uncut Synonyms: Bleached Bandage Cloth for 
Plaster of Paris, Rolled Bandage for Plaster of Paris.
 


Cloth for Plaster of Paris 
Bandages shall consist of cotton cloth of leno weave made from yarn of suitable 
count. It may be supplied cut or uncut of various widths and lengths.

manufacture of Sterile products, Parenteral preparations (Small Volume 
lnjectables and Large Volume Parenterals) and Sterile Ophthalmic Preparations. 
In addition to these requirements, the following specific requirements shall 
also be followed namely:—
 




1. General 
 


Sterile products, being 
very critical and sensitive in nature, a very high degree of precautions, 
prevention and preparations are needed. Dampness, dirt and darkness are to be 
avoided to ensure aseptic conditions in all areas. There shall be strict 
compliance in the prescribed standards especially in the matter of supply of 
water, air, active materials and in the maintenance of hygienic environment.
 




2. Buildings And Civil Works
 


2.1 The Building shall be 
built on proper foundation with standardised materials to avoid cracks in 
critical areas like aseptic solution preparation, filling and sealing rooms.
 


2.2 Location of services 
like water, steam, gases, etc., shall be such that their servicing or repair 
shall not pose any threat to the integrity of the facility. Water, lines shall 
not pose any threat of leakage to aseptic area.
 


2.3 The manufacturing areas 
shall be clearly separated into support areas (e.g. washing and component 
preparation areas, storage areas, etc.), preparation areas (e.g. bulk 
manufacturing area, non-aseptic blending areas, etc.) change areas and aseptic 
areas. Operations like removal of outer cardboard wrappings of primary packaging 
materials shall be done in the de-cartoning areas which are segregated from the 
washing areas. Wooden pallets, fiber board drums, cardboard and other particle 
shedding materials shall not be taken inside the preparation areas.
 


2.4 In aseptic areas—
 


        (a)  Walls, floors 
and ceiling should be impervious, non-shedding, non flaking and non-cracking. 
Flooring should be unbroken and provided with a cove both at the junction 
between the wall and the floor as well as the wall and the ceiling;
 


        (b)  walls shall be 
flat, and ledges and recesses shall be avoided. Wherever other surfaces join the 
wall (e.g. sterilisers, electric sockets, gas points etc.) these shall flush the 
walls. Walls shall be provided with a cove at the joint between the ceiling and 
floor;
 


        (c)  ceiling shall 
be solid and joints shall be sealed. Light-fittings and air-grills shall be 
flush with the walls and not hanging from the ceiling, so as to prevent 
contamination;
 


        (d)  there shall be 
no sinks and drains in Grade A and Grade B areas;
 


        (e)  doors shall be 
made of non-shedding material. These may be made preferably of Aluminium or 
Steel material. Wooden doors shall not be used. Doors shall open towards the 
higher-pressure area so that they close automatically due to air pressure;
 


         (f)  Windows shall 
be made of similar material as the doors, preferably with double panel and shall 
be flush with the walls. If fire escapes are to be provided, these shall be 
suitably fastened to the walls without any gaps;
 


        (g)  the furniture 
used shall be smooth, washable and made of stainless steel or any other 
appropriate material other than wood.
 


2.5 The manufacturing and

for aseptic areas, except the environmental standards which may vary in the 
critical areas.
 


2.6 Change rooms with 
entrance in the form of air-locks shall be provided before entry into the 
sterile product manufacturing areas and then to the aseptic area. Separate exit 
space from the aseptic areas is advisable. Change rooms to the aseptic areas 
shall be clearly demarcated into ‘black’, ‘gray’ and ‘white rooms’ with 
different levels of activity and air cleanliness. The ‘black’ change room shall 
be provided with a hand­washing sink. The sink and its drain in the 
un-classified (first) change rooms may be kept clean all the time. The specially 
designed drain shall be periodically monitored to avoid presence of pathogenic 
micro­organisms. Change room doors shall not be opened simultaneously. An 
appropriate inter-locking system and a visual and/ or audible warning system may 
be installed to prevent the opening of more than one door at a time.
 


2.7 For communication 
between aseptic areas and non-aseptic areas, intercom telephones or speak-phones 
shall be used. These shall be minimum in number.
 


2.8 Material transfer 
between aseptic areas and outside shall be through suitable air-locks or

              5. METHOD OF 
TESTING—(1) Preparation of sample—The sample of disinfectant fluids to be 
tested should be mixed thoroughly taking care that no air is beaten into the 
fluid immediately before withdrawing any portion for testing. The rest portion 
should be withdrawn from the middle of the sample.
 


              (2) Method 
of testing stability after dilution—(a) Preparation of Artificial Hard Water 
: 40 ml. of IN Hydrochloric Acid (Analytical Reagent Quality) is neutralised 
with a slight excess of Calcium Carbonate and filtered. The filtrate is diluted 
to 1000 ml. with distilled water, 10 parts of this solution is further diluted 
to 100 parts with distilled water.
 


              (b) 
Preparation of Artificial Sea Water : 27 G of Sodium Chloride (Analytical 
Reagent Quality) and 5 g of Magnesium Sulphate (Analytical Reagent Quality) are 
dissolved in distilled water and diluted to 1000 ml. The solution is filtered 
before use.
 


              (c) Procedure 
: Take 1 ml. and 5 ml. portions of the sample in duplicate in 100 m. stoppered 
measuring cylinder (IS : 878-1956) by means of pipettes. Dilute the sample with 
Artificial Hard water of Artificial Sea water (as the case may be) upto 10 ml. 
mark. Mix thoroughly by inverting the cylinders 5 times. Keep the cylinders 
containing the diluted fluids for 6 hours at the extremes of the temperature 
range specified for the particular type. The sample complies with the test if 
the solution shows not more than a trace of separation at its top and bottom.
 


              (3) Method 
of determination of Rideal Walker Coefficient (R.W.C.)
 


              
Apparatus—A 
loop, 4 mm. in internal diameter is made at end of a 28 swg (0.376 mm) wire of 
platinum or platinum iridium alloy, 38 mm. long from the loop to the holder. The 
loop is bent at such an angle to the length of the wire as will facilitate in 
removal vertically from the surface of the liquid while keeping the place of the 
loop horizontal.
 


              Incubator—Set 
and maintained at 37oC
 + 1oC.
 


              
Pipettes—Standard graduated pipettes of capacity 10 ml.; 5 ml, and 1 ml.
 


              Dropping 
Pipette—Made to deliver 0.2 ml.
 


              Medication 
tubes—5 sterile plugged rimless test tubes 125 mm x 22 mm (5 inch x 3/4 inch) 
made of hard neutral glass.
 


              Broth 
tubes—About 2 dozens of the same description as medication tubes.
 


              Standard 
measuring cylinders stopped and graduated—500 ml. graduated in 10 ml.—100 ml. 
graduated 1 ml.—five. All apparatus must be scrupulously clean and sterile 
immediately before use.
 


              
Reagents— 
(a) Broth—Prepare a mixture of the following ingredients:
 


              Meat extract 
(Microbiological grade) 20 g. Peptone (Micro biological grade) 20 g. Sodium 
Chloride (Reagent Quality) 10 g. Distilled Water—1000 ml.
 


              Dissolve the 
solid in distilled water add sufficient sodium hydroxide to neutralise the 
solution; then boil it to bring down phosphates and filter while hot. The broth 
thus prepared is then adjusted to pH. 7.6 with normal Hydrochloric acid. The 
broth is then sterilised by autoclaving at 15 lbs. pressure for 20 minutes. It 
is then filtered and placed in 5 ml. quantities in sterilised broth tubes. The 
tubes of media thus prepared are sterilised by autoclaving at 15 Ibs. pressure 
for 10 minutes. The final pH of the medium should lie between 7.3 and 7.5. 
Further resterilisation in bulk or in tubes is not permissible.
 


              (b) Test 
Organism—The organism used in Salmonella typhi (NCTC 786) of which suitable 
culture shall be obtained from the Director, Central Drugs Laboratory, Calcutta. 
This culture is maintained by weekly sub-culture on a nutrient agar slope [made 
by dissolving 2.5 per cent Agar (Bacteriological grade) in the broth prepared as 
above, incubating the sub-culture for 24 hours at 370C 
and then storing in refrigerator at a temperature below 220C. 
For the purpose of the test a little of the growth from the most recent 
sub-culture in nutrient agar slope is placed in tube of R.W. broth and incubated 
for 23 hours at 380C. 
A standard loopful is then transferred to a second tube and incubated as before. 
This is done for at least three times before a test is carried out. 
Sub-culturing in broth is limited to 14 days.
 


              (c) Standard 
phenol : 5 per cent W/V solution in sterile distilled water of chemically pure 
phenol having a crystallising point of not less than 40.50C 
is prepared. Test dilutions are prepared from this stock solution containing 1 
g. of phenol in each 95, 100, 105, 115 ml. of the solution made. These dilutions 
shall be used within a week of preparation.
 


              (d) Test 
dilutions of Disinfectant (sample)—The sample is prepared as described under 
“Preparation of samples”. A test portion of 5 ml. is withdrawn as discharged 
into about 480 ml. of sterile distilled water in a 500 ml. glass stoppered 
sterile measuring cylinder and the pipette is rinsed three times or more in the 
clear liquid. The whole is then made up to 500 ml. with sterile distilled water, 
the cyclinder is stoppered and the contents thoroughly mixed by inverting the 
cylinder several times. Suitable test dilutions in sterile distilled water are 
then immediately prepared from this stock solution.
 


              
Procedure—5 
ml. of 4 chosen dilutions of the disinfectant are placed in 4 medication tubes 
which are then placed in a rack provided with water bath maintained at a 
constant temperature between 170C 
and 190C, 
with strongest dilution on the left. The fifth medication tube containing 5 ml. 
of the particular phenol dilution is placed on the right. When the content on 
the medication tubes and broth culture of the test organism have reached the 
temperature of the water bath, starting at Zero time, 0.2 ml. of the culture is 
added to the left hand medication tube and the tube is shaken gently. After 30 
seconds the next tube is inoculated similarly and the process is repeated with 
each successive tube at intervals of 30 seconds until the phenol control has 
been inoculated. Thirty second after this last addition (that is 2-1/2 minutes 
from zero) a loopful of the well-shaken content of the tube at the extreme left 
is withdrawn and placed in tube containing 5 ml. of the broth medium. Thirty 
second after this similar operation is performed on the second medication tube. 
The procedure is repeated at an interval of 30 seconds with each of the 5 
medication tubes working from left to right until 4 sets of cultures have been 
made i.e. at 2-1/2, 5, 7-1/2 and 10 minutes respectively after exposure. 
In each withdrawal care should be taken to ensure that the loop is removed 
vertically from the surface of the liquid with its place horizontally and 
without touching the side of test tubes. The loop shall be sterilised by flaming 
between each operation, care being taken that the loop is cooled before being 
again used. The inoculated broth tubes are incubated for not less than 48 hours 
and not more than 72 hours at 370C 
when the tubes showing growth of the test organisms will be recognised by 
turbidity of the broth.
 


              Calculation 
of coefficient—The R.W. coefficient is obtained by dividing that dilution of the 
disinfectant which shows life of test organism in 2-1/2 and 5 minutes but no 
life thereafter by that dilution of the phenol which gives the same response.
 


A typical set of sample is 
given below :

the condom and fit the open end on a suitable mount, the condom thus being 
suspended open end upwards. Fill it with 300 ml water at room temperature and 
inspect it after a period of least 1 minute for leakage upto 25 mm from the open 
end. If raise the closed end until water level reaches this distance. After 
atleast 1 minute inspect the newly-wetted part of the condom for leakage. The 
condom shall be deemed to be defective if it bursts during test or shows any 
evidence of leakage or seepage or micro-droplets or does not hold 300 ml. water.
 


11. Quantity of 
Lubricant—(1) 
The condoms shall be dressed with silicone lubricant. The quantity required on 
each individual condom should not be less than 200 gm. and the minimum viscosity 
shall be 200 centistokes.

shall be washed in denatured ethanol or isopropanol, dried and then weighed 
again. All weights shall be recorded to the nearest milligram (mg). Compliance 
with the requirement shall be determined by subtracting the weight of the washed 
and dried condom and its foil package from the weight of the sample condom in 
individual foil package prior to the removal of lubricant. Washing and drying 
may be repeated upto a total of four times if the lubricant quantity is less 
than the required minimum.
 


(3) At least thirteen 
samples shall be drawn from the lot or batch and the samples shall satisfy the 
requirements regarding the quantity of lubricant.
 


12. Colour Fastness—Not 
less than ten samples taken at random from each batch of coloured condoms shall 
pass the following test for colour fastness, namely:—
 


Thoroughly wet inside and 
outside of the condom with distilled water. Make no attempt to remove any 
dusting material or lubricant. Wrap the wet condom in white absorbent paper so 
that the largest possible surface area of the condom is in contact with the 
paper and seal the whole in a suitable container to prevent loss of moisture. 
Allow the container and its contents to stand for 16 hours to 24 hours at room 
temperature. After removing the absorbent paper from the container, examine it 
visually in natural day-light for any indication of staining. No part of the 
absorbent paper shall be stained. If there is any indication of staining of the 
absorbent paper by any colouring agent present in any of the condoms or any 
dusting material or lubricant, the entire batch shall be declared to be not of 
standard quality.
 


13. Labelling, packing 
and storage—(1) 
The condoms shall be individually wrapped and sealed in laminates containing 
atleast eight microns of aluminium foil. The individual condom shall be packed 
in square (non-squeeze condition)/rectangular aluminium foil. The packing shall 
protect the condoms from contamination and mechanical damage. The smallest 
packing offered to the consumer shall bear a clear permanent marking with the 
following particulars, namely:—

container (such as laboratory Bell jar) and subjected to vacuum of 50  + 
10 kpa (gauge) for a period of one minute.
 


Condom packages that do not 
inflate or remain inflated for the period of the test shall be deemed 
non-compliers. In doubtful cases, the test may be repeated, and both the 
inflation and deflation of packages may be observed on application and removal 
of vacuum. An AQL of 2.5 per cent will be applied in assessing the results of 
this test. Thirty-two samples of condoms for a batch size less than 5 lakhs and 
fifty samples of condoms for batch size more than 5 lakhs shall be tested for 
integrity test of individual package seals and the compliance limit or 
acceptance number shall be not more than two or three condoms respectively.
