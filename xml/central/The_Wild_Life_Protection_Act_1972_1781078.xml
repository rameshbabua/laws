 <subsection>
<number>i</number>    core or critical tiger habitat areas 
of National Parks and sanctuaries, where it has been established, on the basis 
of scientific and objective criteria, that such areas are required to be kept as 
inviolate for the purposes of tiger conservation, without affecting the rights 
of the Scheduled Tribes or such other forest dwellers, and notified as such by 
the State Government in consultation with an Expert Committee constituted for 
the purpose;  
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>ii</number>    buffer or peripheral area consisting 
of the area peripheral to critical tiger habitat or core area, identified and 
established in accordance with the provisions contained in Explanation (i), 
above, where a lesser degree of habitat protection is required to ensure the 
integrity of the critical tiger habitat with adequate dispersal for tiger 
species, and which aim at promoting co-existence between wildlife and human 
activity with due recognition of the livelihood, developmental, social and 
cultural rights of the local people, wherein the limits of such areas are 
determined on the basis of scientific and objective criteria in consultation 
with the concerned Gram Sabha and an Expert Committee constituted for the 
purpose.  
 </subsection></section><section>
<number>5</number> Save as for voluntary 
relocation on mutually agreed terms and conditions, provided that such terms and 
conditions satisfy the requirements laid down in this sub-section, no Scheduled 
Tribes or other forest dwellers shall be resettled or have their rights 
adversely affected for the purpose of creating inviolate areas for tiger

impact of their presence upon wild animals is sufficient to cause irreversible 
damage and shall threaten the existence of tigers and their habitat;  
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>iii</number>    the State Government, after obtaining 
the consent of the Scheduled Tribes and other forest dwellers inhabiting the 
area, and in consultation with an independent ecological and social scientist 
familiar with the area, has come to a conclusion that other reasonable options 
of co-existence, are not available;  
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>iv</number>    resettlement or alternative package 
has been prepared providing for livelihood for the affected individuals and 
communities and fulfills the requirements given in the National Relief and 
Rehabilitation Policy;  
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>v</number>    the informed consent of the Gram Sabhas concerned, and of the persons affected, to the resettlement programme has 
been obtained;
