THE CENTRAL ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION (INDIAN ELECTRICITY GRID CODE) REGULATIONS, 20101
 

 
 

ANNEXURE 1 
 

(Refer section 6.1 (d)) 
 

COMPLEMENTARY COMMERCIAL MECHANISMS 
 

1. The beneficiaries shall pay to the respective ISGS Capacity charges corresponding to plant availability and/or Energy charges for the scheduled dispatch, in accordance with the relevant contracts/orders of CERC. The bills for these charges shall be issued by the respective ISGS to each beneficiary on monthly basis. 
 

2. The sum of the above two charges from all beneficiaries shall fully reimburse the ISGS for generation according to the given dispatch schedule. In case of a deviation in actual generation from the dispatch schedule, the concerned ISGS shall receive or shall pay in accordance with UI regulation of CERC. Similarly, the deviation of actual drawl by any regional entity from the net drawl schedule shall be treated as UI. All 15- minute energy figures (net scheduled, actually metered and UI) shall be rounded off to the nearest 0.01 MWh. The UI charges and the modalities of settlement of UI shall be in accordance with UI Regulation of CERC. 
 

3. Wind energy being of variable nature, needs to be predicted with reasonable accuracy for proper scheduling and dispatching of power from these sources in the interconnected system. Hence wind generation forecasting is necessary for increased penetration. Wind generation forecasting can be done on an individual developer basis or joint basis for an aggregated generation capacity of 10 MW and above connected at a connection point of 33 kV and above. If done jointly, the wind forecasting facility shall be built and operated by wind developers in the area and sharing of the cost shall be mutually discussed and agreed. 
 

4. The wind energy forecasting system shall forecast power based on wind flow data at the following time intervals:- 
 
 

(i) Day ahead forecast: Wind/power forecast with an interval of 15 minutes for the next 24 hours for the aggregate Generation capacity of 10 MW and above. 
 

(ii) The schedule by such wind power generating stations supplying inter-State power under long-term access and medium-term and short-term open access may be revised by giving advance notice to RLDC. Such revisions by wind power generating stations shall be effective from 6th time-block, the first being the time-block in which notice was given. There may be maximum of 8 revisions for each 3 hour time slot starting from 00:00 hours during the day. 

 

5. The wind generators shall be responsible for forecasting their generation upto an accuracy of 70%. Therefore, if the actual generation is beyond +/- 30% of the schedule, wind generator would have to bear the UI charges. For actual generation within +/- 30% of the schedule, no UI would be payable/receivable by Generator. The host state, shall bear the UI charges for this variation, i.e.,  within +/- 30%. However, the UI charges borne by the host State due to the wind generation, shall be shared among all the States of the country in the ratio of their peak demands in the previous month based on the data published by CEA, in the form of a regulatory charge known as the Renewable Regulatory Charge operated through the Renewable Regulatory Fund (RRF). This provision shall be applicable with effect from 1-1-2011, for new wind farms with collective capacity of 10 MW and above connected at connection point of 33 KV level and above, and who have not signed any PPA with states or others as on the date of coming into force of this IEGC. Illustrative calculations in respect of above mechanism are given in Appendix. 
 

6. A maximum generation of 150% of the schedule only, would be allowed in a time block, for injection by wind, from the grid security point of view. For any generation above 150% of schedule, if grid security is not affected by the generation above 150%, the only charge payable to the wind energy generator would be the UI charge applicable corresponding to 50- 50.02 HZ. 
 

7. In case of solar generation no UI shall be payable/receivable by Generator. The host state, shall bear the UI charges for any deviation in actual generation from the schedule. However, the net UI charges borne by the host State due to the solar generation, shall be shared among all the States of the country in the ratio of their peak demands in the previous month based on the data published by CEA, in the form of regulatory charge known as the Renewable Regulatory Charge operated through the Renewable Regulatory Fund as referred to in clause 5 above. This provision shall be applicable, with effect from 1-1-2011, for new solar generating plants with capacity of 5 MW and above connected at connection point of 33 KV level and above and, who have not signed any PPA with states or others as on the date of coming into force of this IEGC. Illustrative calculations in respect of above mechanism are given in Appendix. 
 

8. All Regional Energy Accounting calculations carried out by RPC Secretariats shall be open to all regional entities for any checking/verification for a period of 15 days. In case any mistake is detected, RPC Secretariats shall forthwith make a complete check and rectify the mistakes. 
 

9. NLDC shall prepare, within one month of notification of these regulations, a detailed procedure for implementation of the mechanism of Renewable Regulatory Fund and submit the same for approval by the Commission. 
 

10. Regional Energy Accounts on monthly basis shall be prepared and issued by the RFC Secretariats for the purpose of billing and payment of various charges. Regional Energy Account for a month shall be issued in the following month based on the data provided. 
 

11. RPC Secretariats shall also issue the weekly statement for VAR charges, to all regional entities who have a net drawal/injection of reactive energy under low/high voltage conditions. These payments shall also have a high priority and the concerned regional entities and other regional entities shall pay the indicated amounts into regional reactive pool account operated by the RLDC within 10 (ten) days of statement issue, provided that the Commission may direct any entity other than RLDC to operate the regional reactive pool account. The regional entities who have to receive the money on account of VAR charges would then be paid out from the regional reactive pool account, within two (2) working days from the receipt of payment in the Reactive pool account. 
 

12. If payments against the above VAr charges are delayed by more than two days, i.e., beyond twelve (12) days from statement issue, the defaulting regional entity shall have to pay simple interest @ 0.04% for each day of delay. The interest so collected shall be paid to the regional entities who had to receive the amount, payment of which got delayed. Persistent payment defaults, if any, shall be reported by the RLDC to the Member Secretary, RPC, for initiating remedial action. 
 

13. The money remaining in the regional reactive account after pay-out of all VAr charges upto 31st March of every year shall be utilized for training of the SLDC operators, and other similar purposes which would help in improving/streamlining the operation of the respective regional grids, as decided by the respective RPC from time-to-time. 
 

14. In case the voltage profile of a regional grid improves to an extent that the total pay-out from the regional VAr charges account for a week exceeds the total amount being paid-in for that week, and if the regional reactive account has no balance to meet the deficit, the pay-outs shall be proportionately reduced according to the total money available in the above account. 
 

15. The RLDC shall table the complete statement of the regional UI account and the regional Reactive Energy pool account in the RPC's Commercial Committee meeting, on a quarterly basis, for audit by the latter. 
 

16. Interfaces for Scheduling and UI Accounting In Inter-regional Exchanges: 
 

1. The regional boundaries for scheduling, metering and UI accounting of inter-regional exchanges shall be as follows: 
 
 

. Eastern Region end of inter-regional links between Eastern Region and Southern, Western and Northern Regions. 
 

. North-eastern end of inter-regional links between Eastern and North Eastern Region. 
 

. Western Region end of inter-regional links between Southern and Western Region. 
 

. Western Region end of inter-regional links between and Northern and Western Region. 

 

2. No attempt shall be made to split the inter-regional schedules into link-wise schedules (where two regions have two or more interconnections).

THE CENTRAL ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION (INDIAN ELECTRICITY GRID CODE) REGULATIONS, 20101
 

 
 

PART 1 -GENERAL 
 

1.1 Introduction 
 

The Indian Power System is a conglomeration of a number of agencies. Power system means all aspects of generation, transmission, distribution and supply of electricity and includes one or more of the following, namely:- 
 
 

(a) generating stations; 
 

(b) transmission or main transmission lines; 
 

(c) sub-stations; 
 

(d) tie-lines; 
 

(e) load despatch activities; 
 

(f) mains or distribution mains; 
 

(g) electric supply-lines; 
 

(h) overhead lines; 
 

(i) service lines; 
 

(j) works. 

 

1.2 Objective 
 

The IEGC brings together a single set of technical and commercial rules, encompassing all the Utilities connected to/or using the inter-State transmission system (ISTS) and provides the following:- 
 
 

. Documentation of the principles and procedures which define the relationship between the various Users of the inter-State transmission system (ISTS), National Load Despatch Centre, as well as the Regional and State Load Despatch Centers . 
 

. Facilitation of the optimal operation of the grid, facilitation of coordinated and optimal maintenance planning of generation and transmission facilities in the grid and facilitation of development and planning of economic and reliable National/Regional Grid. 
 

. Facilitation for functioning of power markets and ancillary services by defining a common basis of operation of the ISTS, applicable to all the Users of the ISTS. 
 

. Facilitation of the development of renewable energy sources by specifying the technical and commercial aspects for integration of these resources into the grid. 

 

1.3 Scope 
 
 

(i) All Users, SLDCs, RLDCs, NLDC, CEA, CTU, STUs, licensees, RPCs and Power Exchanges are required to abide by the principles and procedures defined in the IEGC in so far as they apply to that party. 
 

(ii) For the purpose of the IEGC, the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) will be treated similar to a SEB, in view of the fact that DVC is a vertically integrated utility like a SEB and has its own generation, transmission and distribution in the identified command area. Accordingly Central Load Despatch at Maithon shall perform functions of SLDC envisaged in this code for the area of DVC. 
 

(iii) For the purpose of the IEGC, the generating stations of the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) and Sardar Sarovar Project (SSP) shall be treated as intra-State generating stations, though their transmission systems shall be a part of the ISTS. This is because of the fact that only some of the States of Northern Region/ Western Region have a Share in BBMB/SSP, and their generating units have to be scheduled and despatched in a very special manner (in coordination with the irrigational requirements). The scheduling and despatch of the BBMB/ SSP generation shall continue to be the responsibility of the BBMB/Narmada Control Authority (NCA), with a proviso that it shall be duly coordinated with the respective Regional Load Despatch Centre and the beneficiaries. 
 

(iv) Any neighbouring country inter-connected with Indian (National) Grid shall be treated as a separate control area.

(viii) The Planning Code specifies the philosophy and procedures to be applied in planning of National Grid, Regional Grids and Inter Regional links. 

 

3.2 Objective 
 

The objectives of Planning Code are as follows: 
 
 

(a) to specify the principles, procedures and criteria which shall be used in the planning and development of the ISTS and inter regional links; 
 

(b) to promote co-ordination amongst all Users, STU/SLDC and CTU/RLDC, NLDC, RPC and CEA in any proposed development of the ISTS; 
 

(c) to provide methodology and information exchange amongst Users, STU/SLDC and CTU/RLDC, RPC, NLDC and CEA in the planning and development of the ISTS. 

 

3.3 Scope 
 

The Planning Code applies to CTU, other Transmission licensees, Inter-State Generating Station (ISGS), connected to and/or using and involved in developing the ISTS. This Planning Code also applies to Generating Companies, IPPs, SEBs/STUs and/licensees, regarding generation and/or transmission of energy to/from the ISTS. 
 

3.4 Planning Philosophy 
 
 

(a) CEA would formulate perspective transmission plan for inter-State transmission system as well as intra-State transmission system. These perspective transmission plans would be continuously updated to take care of the revisions in load projections and generation scenarios considering the seasonal and the time of the day variations. In formulating perspective transmission plan the transmission requirement for evacuating power from renewable energy sources shall also be taken care of. The transmission system required for open access shall also be taken into account in accordance with National Electricity Policy so that congestion in system operation is minimized. 
 

(b) The CTU shall carry out planning process from time-to-time as per the requirement for identification of inter-State transmission system including transmission system associated with Generation Projects, regional and inter-regional system strengthening schemes which shall fit in with the perspective plan developed by CEA. While planning schemes, the following shall be considered in addition to the data of authenticated nature collected from and in consultation with users by CTU:- 
 

(i) Perspective plan formulated by CEA; 
 

(ii) Electric Power Survey of India published by the CEA; 
 

(iii) Transmission Planning Criteria and guidelines issued by the CEA; 
 

(iv) Operational feedback from RPCs; 
 

(v) Operational feedback from NLDC/RLDC/SLDC; 
 

(vi) Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Grant of Connectivity, Long-term Access and Medium-term Open Access in inter-State Transmission and related matters) Regulations, 2009; 
 

(vii) Renewable capacity addition plan issued by Ministry of New and Renewable Energy Sources (MNRES), Government of India. 
 

(c) In addition to the inter-State transmission system, the CTU shall plan, from time-to-time, system strengthening schemes, need of which may arise to overcome the constraints in power transfer and to improve the overall performance of the grid. The inter­-State transmission proposals including system strengthening scheme identified on the basis of the planning studies would be discussed, reviewed and finalized in the meetings of Regional Standing Committees for Transmission Planning constituted by CEA, in consultation with the Regional Entities, RPC, CEA, NLDC and the RLDC and action may be taken by CTU on the basis of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) signed with the beneficiaries. In case of associated transmission system where all PPAs have not yet been signed, and where agreement could not be reached in respect of system strengthening schemes, the CTU may approach CERC for the regulatory approval in accordance with Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Grant of Regulatory Approval for Capital Investment to CTU for execution of Inter-State Transmission Scheme) Regulations, as and when they come into force. 
 

(d) All, STUs and Users will supply to the CTU, the desired planning data from time-to-time to enable to formulate and finalize its plan. 
 

(e) As voltage management plays an important role in inter-State transmission of energy, special attention shall be accorded, by CTU, for planning of capacitors, reactors, SVC and Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems (FACTS), etc. Similar exercise shall be done by STU for intra-State transmission system to optimize the utilistion of the integrated transmission network. 
 

(f) Based on Plans prepared by the CTU, State Transmission Utilities (STU) shall have to plan their systems to further evacuate power from the ISTS and to optimize the use of integrated transmission network. 
 

(g) In case Long-Term Access Applications require any strengthening in the intra-State transmission system to absorb/evacuate power beyond ISTS, the applicant shall co-ordinate with the concerned, STU. STU shall augment the intra-State transmission system in a reasonable time to facilitate the interchange of such power. 
 

(h) The Inter-State Transmission System and associated intra-State transmission system are complementary and inter-dependent and planning of one affects the other's planning and performance. Therefore, the associated intra-State transmission system shall also be discussed and reviewed before implementation during the discussion for finalizing ISTS proposal indicated at 3.4 (b) above. 

 

3.5 Planning Criterion 
 

General Philosophy 
 
 

(a) The planning criterion are based on the security philosophy on which the ISTS has been planned. The security philosophy may be as per the Transmission Planning Criteria and other guidelines as given by CEA. The general policy shall be as detailed below: 
 
 

(i) As a general rule, the ISTS shall be capable of withstanding and be secured against the following contingency outages:-

THE CENTRAL ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION (INDIAN ELECTRICITY GRID CODE) REGULATIONS, 20101
 

 
 

PART 6 
 

SCHEDULING AND DESPATCH CODE 
 

6.1 Introduction. -This Part sets out the- 
 
 

(a) demarcation of responsibilities between various regional entities, SLDC, RLDC and NLDC in scheduling and despatch; 
 

(b) the procedure for scheduling and despatch; 
 

(c) the reactive power and voltage control mechanism; 
 

(d) Complementary commercial mechanisms (in the Annexure  1). 

 

6.2 Objective. -This code deals with the procedures to be adopted for scheduling of the net injection/drawals of concerned regional entities on a day ahead basis with the modality of the flow of information between the NLDC/RLDCs/SLDCs/Power Exchange and regional entities. The procedure for submission of capability declaration by each ISGS and submission of requisition/drawal schedule by other regional entities is intended to enable RLDCs to prepare the despatch schedule for each ISGS and drawal schedule for each regional entity. It also provides methodology of issuing real time despatch/drawal instructions and rescheduling, if required, to regional entities along with the commercial arrangement for the deviations from schedules, as well as, mechanism for reactive power pricing. This code also provides the methodology for re­scheduling of wind and solar energy on three (3) hourly basis and the methodology of compensating the wind and solar energy rich State for dealing with the variable generation through a Renewable Regulatory charge. For this, appropriate meters and Data Acquisition System facility shall be provided for accounting of UI charges and transfer of information to concerned SLDC and RLDC. 
 

The provisions contained in this Part are without prejudice to the powers conferred on RLDC under sections 28 and 29 of the Electricity Act, 2003. 
 

6.3 Scope. -This code will be applicable to NLDC, RLDC/SLDCs, ISGS, Distribution Licensees/SEBs/STUs/regional entities, Power Exchanges, wind and solar generating stations and other concerned persons in the National and Regional grid. 
 

The scheduling and despatch procedure for the generating stations of Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) shall be as per the procedure formulated by the BBMB in consultation with NRLDC. 
 

Similarly, the scheduling and despatch procedure for the generating stations of Sardar Sarovar Project (SSP) shall be as per the procedure formulated by the Western Regional Load Despatch Centre (WRLDC) in consultation with Narmada Control Authority (NCA). 
 

6.4 Demarcation of responsibilities. -1. The national interconnected grid is divided into control areas, like Regional ISTS, States, DVC, etc., where the load dispatch centre or system operator of the respective control area controls its generation and/or load to maintain its interchange schedule with other control areas whenever required to do so and contributes to frequency regulation of the synchronously operating system. The Load Despatch Centre of a control area therefore is responsible for coordinating the scheduling of a generating station, within the control area, real-time monitoring of the station's operation, checking that there is no gaming (gaming is an intentional mis-declaration of a parameter related to commercial mechanism in vogue, in order to make an undue commercial gain) in its availability declaration, or in any other way revision of availability declaration and injection schedule, switching instructions, metering and energy accounting, issuance of UI accounts within the control area, collections/disbursement of UI payments, outage planning, etc. The following clause gives the criteria for demarcation of control area jurisdiction. 
 

2. The following generating stations shall come under the respective Regional ISTS control area and hence the respective RLDC shall coordinate the scheduling of the following generating stations:- 
 
 

(a) Central Generating Stations (excluding stations where full Share is allocated to host state); 
 

(b) UItra-Mega power projects; 
 

(c) In other cases, the control area shall be decided on the following criteria:- 
 
 

(i) If a generating station is connected only to the ISTS, RLDC shall coordinate the scheduling, except for Central Generating Stations where full Share is allocated to one State. 
 

(ii) If a generating station is connected only to the State transmission network, the SLDC shall coordinate scheduling, except for the case as at (a) above. 
 

(iii) If a generating station is connected both to ISTS and the State network, scheduling and other functions performed by the system operator of a control area will be done by SLDC, only if state has more than 50% Share of power. The role of concerned RLDC, in such a case, shall be limited to consideration of the schedule for inter state exchange of power on account of this ISGS while determining the net drawal schedules of the respective states. If the State has a Share of 50% or less, the scheduling and other functions shall be performed by RLDC. 
 

(iv) In case commissioning of a plant is done in stages the decision regarding scheduling and other functions performed by the system operator of a control area would be taken on the basis of above criteria depending on generating capacity put into commercial operation at that point of time. Therefore it could happen that the plant may be in one control area ( i.e.  SLDC) at one point of time and another control area ( i.e.  RLDC) at another point of time. The switch over of control area would be done expeditiously after the change, w.e.f. the next billing period. 


 

3. There may be exceptions with respect to above provisions, for reasons of operational expediency, subject to approval of CERC. Irrespective of the control area the jurisdiction, if a generating station is connected both to the ISTS and the STU, the load dispatch centre of the control area under whose jurisdiction the generating station falls, shall take into account grid security implication in the control area of he other load dispatch centre. 
 

4. For those generating station supplying power to any state other than host state and whose scheduling is not coordinated by RLDC, the role of the concerned RLDC shall be limited to consideration of the schedule for inter-State exchange of power on account of this generating station while determining the net drawal schedules of the respective control area. 
 

5. The Regional grids shall be operated as power pools with decentralized scheduling and despatch, in which the States shall have operational autonomy, and SLDCs shall have the total responsibility for- 
 
 

(i) scheduling/despatching their own generation (including generation of their embedded licensees), 
 

(ii) regulating the demand of its control area, 
 

(iii) scheduling their drawal from the ISGS (within their share in the respective plant's expected capability), 
 

(iv) permitting long-term access, medium-term and short-term open access transactions for embedded generators/consumers, in accordance with the contracts, and 
 

(v) regulating the net drawal of their control area from the regional grid in accordance with the respective regulations of the CERC. 

 

6. The system of each regional entity shall be treated and operated as a notional control area. The algebraic summation of scheduled drawal from ISGS and from contracts through a long-term access, medium-term and short-term open access arrangements shall provide the drawal schedule of each regional entity, and this shall be determined in advance on day-ahead basis. The regional entities shall regulate their generation and/or consumers' load so as to maintain their actual drawal from the regional grid close to the above schedule. If regional entities deviate from the drawal schedule, within the limit specified by the CERC in UI Regulations as long as such deviations do not cause system parameters to deteriorate beyond permissible limits and/or do not lead to unacceptable line loading. However, such deviations from net drawal schedule shall be priced through the Unscheduled Interchange (UI) mechanism. 
 

7. The SLDC, SEB/distribution licensee shall always endeavour to restrict the net drawal of the state from the grid to within the drawal schedules, whenever the system frequency is below 49.7 Hz. The concerned SEB/distribution licensee User, SLDC shall ensure that their automatic demand management scheme mentioned in clause 5.4.2 acts to ensure that there is no over drawl when frequency is 49.5 Hz or below. If the automatic demand management scheme has not yet been commissioned, then action has to be taken as per manual demand management scheme to ensure zero overdrawal when frequency is 49.5 Hz. or below. 
 

8. The SLDCs/STUs/Distribution Licensees shall regularly carry out the necessary exercises regarding short-term demand estimation for their respective States/area, to enable them to plan in advance as to how they would meet their consumers' load without overdrawing from the grid. 
 

9. The ISGS, other generating stations and sellers shall be responsible for power generation/power injection generally according to the daily schedules advised to them by the RLDC/SLDC on the basis of the contracts/ requisitions received from the SLDCs/buyers/Power Exchanges. 
 

10. The ISGS would normally be expected to generate power according to the daily schedules advised to them. The ISGS may also deviate from the given schedules within the limits specified in the CERC UI Regulations of CERC, depending on the plant and system conditions. In particular, they may be allowed to generate beyond the given schedule under deficit conditions as long as such deviations do not cause system parameters to deteriorate beyond permissible limits and/or do not lead to unacceptable line loading. Deviations, if any, from the ex-power plant generation schedules shall be appropriately priced in accordance with UI Regulations. In addition, deviations, from schedules causing congestion, shall also be priced in accordance with the Congestion Charge Regulations of CERC. 
 

11. Provided that when the frequency is higher than 50.2 Hz, the actual net injection shall not exceed the scheduled despatch for that time block. Also, while the frequency is above 50.2 Hz, the ISGS may (at their discretion) back down without waiting for an advice from RLDC to restrict the frequency rise. When the frequency falls below 49.7 Hz, the generation at all ISGS (except those on peaking duty) shall be maximized, at least upto the level to which can be sustained, without waiting for an advice from RLDC subject to the condition that such increase does not lead to unacceptable line loading or system parameters to deteriorate beyond permissible limit. 
 

12. However, notwithstanding the above, the RLDC may direct the SLDCs/ISGS/other regional entities to increase/decrease their drawal/generation in case of contingencies e.g ., overloading of lines/transformers, abnormal voltages, threat to system security. Such directions shall immediately be acted upon. In case the situation does not call for very urgent action, and RLDC has some time for analysis, it shall be checked whether the situation has arisen due deviations from schedules, pursuant to short-term open access. These shall be got terminated first, before an action, which would affect the scheduled supplies to the long-term and medium-term customers is initiated in accordance with Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Grant of Connectivity, Long-term Access and Medium-term Open Access in inter-State Transmission and related matters) Regulations, 2009. 
 

13. For all outages of generation and transmission system, which may have an effect on the regional grid, all Regional entities shall co-operate with each other and coordinate their actions through Operational Coordination Committee (OCC) for outages foreseen sufficiently in advance and through RLDC (in all other cases), as per procedures finalized separately by OCC. In particular, outages requiring restriction of ISGS generation and/or restriction of ISGS Share which a beneficiary can receive and curtailment of other long-term transactions shall be planned carefully to achieve the best optimization. 
 

14. The regional entities shall enter into separate joint/bilateral agreement(s) to identify the beneficiary's Shares in ISGS (based on the allocations by the Govt. of India, where applicable), scheduled drawal pattern, tariffs, payment terms etc. All such agreements shall be filed with the concerned RLDC(s) and RPC, Secretariat, for being considered in scheduling and regional energy accounting. Any bilateral agreements between buyer and seller for scheduled interchanges on long-term, medium-term basis shall also specify the interchange schedule, which shall be duly filed with CTU and CTU shall inform RLDC and SLDC, as the case may be about these agreements in accordance with Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Grant of Connectivity, Long-term Access and Medium-term Open Access in inter-State Transmission and Related Matters) Regulations, 2009. 
 

15. All regional entities should abide by the concept of frequency-linked load despatch and pricing of deviations from schedule, i.e. , unscheduled interchanges. All regional entities should normally be operated according to the standing frequency-linked load despatch guidelines issued by the RLDC, to the extent possible, unless otherwise advised by the RLDC/SLDC. 
 

16. The ISGS shall make an advance declaration of ex-power plant MW and MWh capabilities foreseen for the next day, i.e. , from 0000 hrs to 2400 hrs. During fuel shortage condition, in case of thermal stations, they may specify minimum MW, maximum MW, MWh capability and declaration of fuel shortage. The generating stations shall also declare the possible ramping up/ramping down in a block. In case of a gas turbine generating station or a combined cycle generating station, the generating station shall declare the capacity for units and modules on APM gas, RLNG and liquid fuel separately, and these shall be scheduled separately. 
 

17. While making or revising its declaration of capability, except in case of Run Off the River (with up to three hour pondage) hydro stations, the ISGS shall ensure that the declared capability during peak hours is not less than that during other hours. However, exception to this rule shall be allowed in case of tripping/re-synchronisation of units as a result of forced outage of units. 
 

18. It shall be incumbent upon the ISGS to declare the plant capabilities faithfully, i.e. , according to their best assessment. In case, it is suspected that they have deliberately over/under declared the plant capability contemplating to deviate from the schedules given on the basis of their capability declarations (and thus make money either as undue capacity charge or as the charge for deviations from schedule), the RLDC may ask the ISGS to explain the situation with necessary backup data. 
 

19. The ISGS shall be required to demonstrate the declared capability of its generating station as and when asked by the Regional Load Despatch Centre of the region in which the ISGS is situated. In the event of the ISGS failing to demonstrate the declared capability, the capacity charges due to the generator shall be reduced as a measure of penalty. 
 

20. The quantum of penalty for the first mis-declaration for any duration/block in a day shall be the charges corresponding to two days fixed charges. For the second mis-declaration the penalty shall be equivalent to fixed charges for four days and for subsequent mis-declarations, the penalty shall be multiplied in the geometrical progression over a period of a month. 
 

21. The CTU shall install special energy meters on all inter connections between the regional entities and other identified points for recording of actual net MWh interchanges and MVArh drawals. The installation, operation and maintenance of special energy meters shall be in accordance with Central Electricity Authority (Installation and Operation of Meters) Regulations, 2006. All concerned entities (in whose premises the special energy meters are installed) shall take weekly meter readings and transmit them to the RLDC by Tuesday noon. The SLDC must ensure that the meter data from all installations within their control area are transmitted to the RLDC within the above schedule. 
 

22. The RLDC shall be responsible for computation of actual net injection/drawal of concerned regional entities, 15 minute-wise, based on the above meter readings. The above data along with the processed data of meters shall be forwarded by the RLDC to the RPC secretariat on a weekly basis by each Thursday noon for the seven day period ending on the previous Sunday mid-night, to enable the latter to prepare and issue the Unscheduled inter-change (UI) account in accordance with the CERC (Unschesduled Interchange charges and related matters) Regulations, 2010, as amended form time-to-time. All computations carried out by RLDC shall be open to all regional entities for checking/verifications for a period of 15 days. In case any mistake/omission is detected, the RLDC shall forthwith make a complete check and rectify the same. 
 

23. The operating log books of the generating station shall be available for review by the Regional Power Committee. These books shall keep record of machine operation and maintenance. 
 

24. Hydro generating stations are expected to respond to grid frequency changes and inflow fluctuations. The hydro generating stations shall be free to deviate from the given schedule without causing grid constraint and a compensation for difference between the actual net energy supply by the hydro generating station and the scheduled energy (ex-bus) over day shall be made by the concerned Regional Load Despatch Centre in the day ahead schedule for the 4th day (day plus 3). 
 

25. RLDC shall periodically review the actual deviation from the despatch and net drawal schedules being issued, to check whether any of the regional entities are indulging in unfair gaming or collusion. In case any such practice is detected, the matter shall be reported to the Member Secretary, RPC for further investigation/action. 
 

26. NLDC shall be responsible for scheduling and despatch of electricity over inter-regional links in accordance with the grid code specified by Central Commission in coordination with Regional Load Despatch Centers. NLDC shall be responsible for coordination with Regional Load Despatch Centers for the energy accounting of inter-regional exchange of power. NLDC shall also be responsible for coordination for trans-national exchange of power. 
 

27. NLDC shall develop a procedure for scheduling of collective transaction through Power Exchanges, scheduling of inter-regional power exchanges including HVDC setting responsibility and power exchanges of the country with other countries. 
 

6.5 Scheduling and Despatch procedure for long-term access, medium-term and short-term open access. -(to be read with provisions of Open Access Regulations 2008 as amended from time-to-time. The scheduling procedure for medium-term open access transactions shall be similar to the scheduling procedure for long-term access transactions and is as given below, except where it is specifically mentioned for collective transactions): 
 

1. All inter-State generating stations (ISGS) shall be duly listed on the respective RLDC and SLDC web-sites. The station capacities and allocated/contracted Shares of different beneficiaries shall also be listed out. 
 

2. Each State shall be entitled to a MW despatch up to (foreseen ex- power plant MW capability for the day) x (State's Share in the station's capacity) for all such stations. In case of hydro-electric stations, there would also be a limit on daily MWh despatch equal to (MWh generation capacity for the day) X (State's Share in the station's capacity). 
 

3. By 8 AM every day, the ISGS shall advise the concerned RLDC, the station-wise ex-power plant MW and MWh capabilities foreseen for the next day, i.e. , from 0000 hrs to 2400 hrs of the following day. 
 

4. The above information of the foreseen capabilities of the ISGS and the corresponding MW and MWh entitlements of each State, shall be compiled by the RLDC every day for the next day, and advised to all beneficiaries by 10 AM. The SLDCs shall review it vis-a-vis their foreseen load pattern and their own generating capability including bilateral exchanges, if any, and advise the RLDC by 3 PM their drawal schedule for each of the ISGS in which they have Shares, long-term and medium-term bilateral interchanges, approved short-term bilateral interchanges. 
 

5. Scheduling of collective transaction:- 
 
 

(a) NLDC shall indicate to Power Exchange(s), the list of interfaces/control areas/regional transmission systems on which unconstrained flows are required to be advised by the Power Exchange(s) to the NLDC. Power Exchange(s) shall furnish the interchange on various interfaces/control areas/regional transmission systems as intimated by NLDC. Power Exchange(s) shall also furnish the information of total drawal and injection in each of the regions. Based on the information furnished by the Power Exchanges, NLDC shall check for congestion. In case of congestion, NLDC shall inform the Exchanges about the period of congestion and the available limit for scheduling of collective transaction on respective interface/control area/transmission systems during the period of congestion for Scheduling of Collective Transaction through the respective Power Exchange. The limit for scheduling of collective transaction for respective Power Exchange shall be worked out in accordance with CERC directives. Based on the application for scheduling of Collective Transaction submitted by the Power Exchange(s), NLDC shall send the details (Scheduling Request of Collective Transaction) to different RLDCs for final checking and incorporating them in their schedules. After getting confirmation from RLDCs, NLDC shall convey the acceptance of scheduling of collective transaction to Power Exchange(s). RLDCs shall schedule the Collective Transaction at the respective periphery of the Regional Entities. 
 

(b) The individual transactions for State Utilities/intra-State Entities shall be scheduled by the respective SLDCs. Power Exchange(s) shall send the detailed break up of each point of injection and each point of drawal within the State to respective SLDCs after receipt of acceptance from NLDC. Power Exchange(s) shall ensure necessary coordination with SLDCs for scheduling of the transactions. 
 

(c) Timeline for above activities will be as per detailed procedure for Scheduling of Collective Transaction issued in accordance with CERC (Open access in inter-State transmission) Regulations, 2008 and as amended from time-to-time. 

 

6. The SLDCs may also give standing instructions to the RLDC such that the RLDC itself may decide the best drawal schedules for the States. 
 

7. By 6 PM each day, the RLDC shall convey: 
 
 

(i) The ex-power plant "despatch schedule" to each of the ISGS, in MW for different time block, for the next day. The summation of the ex-power plant drawal schedules advised by all beneficiaries shall constitute the ex-power plant station-wise despatch schedule. 
 

(ii) The "net drawal schedule" to each regional entity, in MW for different time block, for the next day. The summation of the station-wise ex-power plant drawal schedules from all ISGS and drawal from/injection to regional grid consequent to other long-term access, medium-term and short-term open access transactions, after deducting the transmission losses (estimated), shall constitute the regional entity-wise drawal schedule. 

 

8. The SLDCs/ISGS shall inform any modifications/changes to be made in drawal schedule/foreseen capabilities, if any, to RLDC by 10 PM or preferably earlier. 
 

9. The hydro electric generation stations are expected to respond to grid frequency changes and inflow fluctuations. They would, therefore, be free to deviate from the given schedule as long as they do not cause a grid constraint. As a result, the actual net energy supply by a hydro generating station over a day may differ from schedule energy (ex-bus) for that day. A compensation shall then be made by the concerned  

  load despatch centre in the day ahead schedule for the 4th day (day plus 3). 
 

10. The declaration of the generating capability by hydro ISGS should include limitation on generation during specific time periods, if any, on account of restriction(s) on water use due to irrigation, drinking water, industrial, environmental considerations etc. The concerned Load Despatch Centre shall periodically check that the generating station is declaring the capacity and energy sincerely, and is not manipulating the declaration with the intent of making undue money through UI. 
 

11. Since variation of generation in run-of-river power stations shall lead to spillage, these shall be treated as must run stations. All renewable energy power plants, except for biomass power plants, and non-fossil fuel based cogeneration plants whose tariff is determined by the CERC shall be treated as 'MUST RUN' power plants and shall not be subjected to 'merit order despatch' principles. 
 

12. Run-of-river power station with pondage and storage type power stations are designed to operate during peak hours to meet system peak demand. Maximum capacity of the station declared for the day shall be equal to the installed capacity including overload capability, if any, minus auxiliary consumption, corrected for the reservoir level. The Regional Load Despatch Centers shall ensure that generation schedules of such type of stations are prepared and the stations despatched for optimum utilization of available hydro energy except in the event of specific system requirements/constraints. 
 

13. The schedule finalized by the concerned load despatch centre for hydro generating station, shall normally be such that the scheduled energy for a day equals the total energy (ex-bus) expected to be available on that day, as declared by the generating station, based on foreseen/planned water availability/release. It is also expected that the total net energy actually supplied by the generating station on that day would equal the declared total energy, in order that the water release requirement is met. While the 15- minute wise, deviations from schedule would be accounted for as Unscheduled Interchange (UI), the net energy deviation for the whole day, if any, shall be additionally accounted for as shown in the illustration. 
 

Illustration 
 

Suppose the foreseen/expected total energy (ex-bus) for Day-1 is E1, the scheduled energy is S1, actual net energy (metered) is A1, all in ex-bus MWh. Suppose the expected energy availability for Day 4, as declared by the generator, is E4. Then, the schedule for day 4 shall be drawn up such that the scheduled energy for Day 4, shall be 
 

S4=E4+(A1-(E1)), Similarly, 
 

S5= E5+(A2-(E2)), 
 

S6=E6+(A3-(E3)), S7=E7+(A4- 
 

(E4)), and so on." 
 

14. While finalizing the above daily despatch schedules for the ISGS, RLDC shall ensure that the same are operationally reasonable, particularly in terms of ramping-up/ramping-down rates and the ratio between minimum and maximum generation levels. A ramping rate of upto 200 MW per hour should generally be acceptable for an ISGS and for a regional entity (50 MW in NER), except for hydro-electric generating stations which may be able to ramp up/ramp down at a faster rate. 
 

15. While finalizing the drawal and despatch schedules as above, the RLDC shall also check that the resulting power flows do not give rise to any transmission constraints. In case any impermissible constraints are foreseen, the RLDC shall moderate the schedules to the required extent, under intimation to the concerned regional entities. Any changes in the scheduled quantum of power which are too fast or involve unacceptably large steps, may be converted into suitable ramps by the RLDC. 
 

16. In the event of bottleneck in evacuation of power due to any constraint, outage, failure or limitation in the transmission system, associated switchyard and substations owned by the Central Transmission Utility or any other transmission licensee involved in inter-state transmission (as certified by the RLDC) necessitating reduction in generation, the RLDC shall revise the schedules which shall become effective from the 4th time block, counting the time block in which the bottleneck in evacuation of power has taken place to be the first one. Also, during the first, second and third time blocks of such an event, the scheduled generation of the ISGS shall be deemed to have been revised to be equal to actual generation, and the scheduled drawals of the beneficiaries shall be deemed to have been revised accordingly. 
 

17. In case of any grid disturbance, scheduled generation of all the ISGS and scheduled drawal of all the beneficiaries shall be deemed to have been revised to be equal to their actual generation/drawal for all the time blocks affected by the grid disturbance. Certification of grid disturbance and its duration shall be done by the RLDC. 
 

18. Revision of declared capability by the ISGS(s) having two part tariff with capacity charge and energy charge (except hydro stations) and requisition by beneficiary(ies) for the remaining period of the day shall also be permitted with advance notice. Revised schedules/declared capability in such cases shall become effective from the 6th time block, counting the time block in which the request for revision has been received in the RLDC to be the first one. Provided that RLDC may allow revision, of the DC at 6 hourly intervals effective form 0000,0600,1200 and 1800 hours in case of Run of the River (ROR) and pondage based hydro generating stations, if there is large variation of expected energy (MWh) for the day compared to previous declaration. 
 

2[18(a). Notwithstanding anything contained in Regulation 6.5.18, in case of forced outages of a unit, for those stations who have a two part tariff based on capacity charge and energy charge for long-term, and medium-term contracts, the RLDC shall revise the schedule on the basis of revised declared capability. The revised declared capability and the revised schedules shall become effective from the fourth time block, counting the time block in which the revision is advised by the ISGS to be the first one.] 
 

19. Notwithstanding anything contained in Regulation 6.5(18), in case of forced outage of a unit for a Short-Term bilateral transaction, where a generator of capacity of 100 MW and above is seller, the generator shall immediately intimate the same along with the requisition for revision of schedule and estimated time of restoration of the unit, to SLDC/RLDC as the case may be. With the objective of not affecting the existing contracts, the revision of schedule shall be with the consent of the buyer till 31-7-2010. Thereafter, consent of the buyer shall not be a pre-requisite for such revision of schedule. The schedule of the generator and the buyer shall be revised, accordingly. The revised schedules shall become effective from the 4th time block, counting the time block in which the forced outage is declared to be the first one. The RLDC shall inform the revised schedule to the seller and the buyer. The original schedule shall become effective from the estimated time of restoration of the unit. However the transmission charges as per original schedule shall continue to be paid for two days. 
 

20. If, at any point of time, the RLDC observes that there is need for revision of the schedules in the interest of better system operation, it may do so on its own, and in such cases, the revised schedules shall become effective from the 4th time block, counting the time block in which the revised schedule is issued by the RLDC to be the first one. 
 

21. To discourage frivolous revisions, an RLDC may, at its sole discretion, refuse to accept schedule/capability changes of less than two (2) percent of previous schedule/capability. The schedule of thermal generating stations indicating fuel shortage while intimating the Declared Capacity to the RLDC shall not be revised except in case of forced outage of generating unit: 
 

Provided that in case of gas based ISGS, for optimum utilization of gas, this shall be permitted, i.e.,  in case of tripping of a unit, this gas may be diverted to another unit using the same gas. 
 

22. The Regional Load Despatch Centre shall also formulate the procedure for meeting contingencies both in the long run and in the short run (Daily scheduling). 
 

23. Special dispensation for scheduling of wind and solar generation 
 
 

(i) With effect from 1-1-2011 Scheduling of wind power generation plants would have to be done for the purpose of UI where the sum of generation capacity of such plants connected at the connection point to the transmission or distribution system is 10 MW and above and connection point is 33 KV and above, and where PPA has not yet been signed. For capacity and voltage level below this, as well as for old wind farms (A wind farm is collection of wind turbine generators that are connected to a common connection point) it could be mutually decided between the Wind Generator and the transmission or distribution utility, as the case may be, if there is no existing contractual agreement to the contrary. The schedule by wind power generating stations may be revised by giving advance notice to SLDC/RLDC, as the case may be. Such revisions by wind power generating stations shall be effective from 6th time-block, the first being the time-block in which notice was given. There may be maximum of 8 revisions for each 3 hour time slot starting from 00:00 hours during the day. 
 

(ii) The schedule of solar generation shall be given by the generator based on availability of the generator, weather forecasting, solar insolation, season and normal solar generation curve and shall be vetted by the RLDC in which the generator is located and incorporated in the inter-State schedule. If RLDC is of the opinion that the schedule is not realistic, it may ask the solar generator to modify the schedule. 
 

(iii) Concerned RLDC and SLDC shall maintain the record of schedule from renewable power generating stations based on type of renewable energy sources i.e.,  wind or solar from the point of view of grid security. While scheduling generating stations in a region, system operator shall aim at utilizing available wind and solar energy fully. 

 

24. Generation schedules and drawal schedules issued/revised by the Regional Load Despatch Centre shall become effective from designated time block irrespective of communication success. 
 

25. For any revision of scheduled generation, including post facto deemed revision, there shall be a corresponding revision of scheduled drawals of the beneficiaries. 
 

26. A procedure for recording the communication regarding changes to schedules duly taking into account the time factor shall be evolved by the Central Transmission Utility. 
 

27. When for the reason of transmission constraints e.g.,  congestion or in the interest of grid security, it becomes necessary to curtail power flow on a transmission corridor, the transactions already scheduled may be curtailed by the Regional Load Despatch Centre. 
 

28. The short-term customer shall be curtailed first followed by the medium-term customers, which shall be followed by the long-term customers and amongst the customers of a particular category, curtailment shall be carried out on pro rata basis. 
 

29. After the operating day is over at 2400 hours, the schedule finally implemented during the day (taking into account all before-the-fact changes in despatch schedule of generating stations and drawal schedule of the States) shall be issued by RLDC. These schedules shall be the datum for commercial accounting. The average ex-bus capability for each ISGS shall also be worked out based on all before-the-fact advice to RLDC. 
 

30. Collective Transaction through Power Exchange(s) would normally be curtailed subsequent to the Short-Term Bilateral Transaction(s). 
 

31. RLDCs would curtail a Transaction at the periphery of the Regional Entities. SLDC(s) shall further incorporate the inter-se curtailment of intra-State Entities to implement the curtailment. 
 

32. RLDC shall properly document all above information i.e.,  station-wise foreseen ex-power plant capabilities advised by the generating stations, the drawal schedules advised by regional entities, all schedules issued by the RLDC, and all revisions/updating of the above. 
 

33. The procedure for scheduling and the final schedules issued by RLDC, shall be open to all regional entities and other regional open access customers entities for any checking/verification, for a period of 5 days. In case any mistake/omission is detected, the RLDC shall forthwith make a complete check and rectify the same. 
 

34. While availability declaration by ISGS shall have a resolution of one (1) MW and one (1) MWh, all entitlements, requisitions and schedules shall be rounded off to the nearest two decimal at each control area boundary for each of the transaction, to have a resolution of 0.01 MW and 0.01 MWh. 
 

6.6 Reactive Power and Voltage Control. -1. Reactive power compensation should ideally be provided locally, by generating reactive power as close to the reactive power consumption as possible. The Regional Entities except Generating Stations are therefore expected to provide local VAr compensation/generation such that they do not draw VArs from the EHV grid, particularly under low-voltage condition. To discourage VAr drawals by Regional Entities except Generating Stations, VAr exchanges with ISTS shall be priced as follows: 
 

The Regional Entity except Generating Stations pays for VAr drawal when voltage at the metering point is below 97% 
 

The Regional Entity except Generating Stations gets paid for VAr return when voltage is below 97% 
 

The Regional Entity except Generating Stations gets paid for VAr drawal when voltage is above 103% 
 

The Regional Entity except Generating Stations pays for VAr return when voltage is above 103% 
 

Provided that there shall be no charge/payment for VAr drawal/retura by a Regional Entity except Generating Stations on its own line emanating directly from an ISGS. 
 

2. The charge for VArh shall be at the rate of 10 paise/kVArh w.e.f. 3-5-2010, and this will be applicable between the Regional Entity, except Generating Stations, and the regional pool account for VAr inter-changes. This rate shall be escalated at 0.5 paise/kVArh per year thereafter, unless otherwise revised by the Commission. 
 

3. Notwithstanding the above, RLDC may direct a Regional Entity except Generating Stations to curtail its VAr drawal/injection in case the security of grid or safety of any equipment is endangered. 
 

4. In general, the Regional Entities except Generating Stations shall endeavor to minimize the VAr drawal at an interchange point when the voltage at that point is below 95% of rated, and shall not return VAr when the voltage is above 105%. ICT taps at the respective drawal points may be changed to control the VAr inter-change as per a Regional Entity except Generating Stations's request to the RLDC, but only at reasonable intervals. 
 

5. Switching in/out of all 400 kV bus and line Reactors throughout the grid shall be carried out as per instructions of RLDC. Tap changing on all 400/220 kV ICTs shall also be done as per RLDCs instructions only. 
 

6. The ISGS and other generating stations connected to regional grid shall generate/absorb reactive power as per instructions of RLDC, within capability limits of the respective generating units, that is without sacrificing on the active generation required at that time. No payments shall be made to the generating companies for such VAr generation/absorption. 
 

7. VAr exchange directly between two Regional Entities except Generating Stations on the interconnecting lines owned by them (singly or jointly) generally address or cause a local voltage problem, and generally do not have an impact on the voltage profile of the regional grid. Accordingly, the management/control and commercial handling of the VAr exchanges on such lines shall be as per following provisions, on case-by-case basis:- 
 
 

(i) The two concerned Regional Entities except Generating Stations may mutually agree not to have any charge/payment for VAr exchanges between them on an interconnecting line. 
 

(ii) The two concerned Regional Entities except Generating Stations may mutually agree to adopt a payment rate/scheme for VAr exchanges between them identical to or at variance from that specified by CERC for VAr exchanges with ISTS. If the agreed scheme requires any additional metering, the same shall be arranged by the concerned Beneficiaries. 
 

(iii) In case of a disagreement between the concerned Regional Entities except Generating Stations ( e.g.,  one party wanting to have the charge/payment for VAr exchanges, and the other party refusing to have the scheme), the scheme as specified in Annexure-2 shall be applied. The per kVArh rate shall be as specified by CERC for VAr exchanges with ISTS. 
 

(iv) The computation and payments for such VAr exchanges shall be effected as mutually agreed between the two beneficiaries.
