    not have been admitted in evidence without the payment of duty and penalty 
    under section 35, or without the payment of a higher duty and penalty than 
    those paid, it may record a declaration to that effect, and determine the 
    amount of duty with which such instrument is chargeable, and may require any 
    person in whose possession or power such instrument then is, to produce the 
    same, and may impound the same when produced.  
 </section><section>
<number>3</number> When any 
    declaration has been recorded under sub-section (2), the Court recording the 
    same shall send a copy thereof to the Collector, and, where the instrument

    such Court, shall also send him such instrument.  
 </section><section>

    admitting such instrument in evidence, or in any certificate granted under 
    section 42, or in section 43, prosecute any person for any offence against 
    the Stamp-law which the Collector considers him to have committed in respect 
    of such instrument:  
 
Provided that—  
 <subsection>
<number>a</number>    no such prosecution 
    shall be instituted where the amount (including duty and penalty) which, 
    according to the determination of such Court, was payable in respect of the 
    instrument under section 35, is paid to the Collector, unless he thinks that 
    the offence was committed with an intention of evading payment of the proper duty;  
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>b</number>    except for the purposes 
    of such prosecution, no declaration made under this section shall effect the
