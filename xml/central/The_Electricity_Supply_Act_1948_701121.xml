The First Schedule
 


(See 
sections 34 and 36)
 




Arrangements in Respect of Controlled Stations 
 




Part I
 



Assumption of control
 



I. 
(1) The Board shall by notice in writing to the licensee fix a date (hereafter 
in this Schedule referred to as the date of control), being the first day of a 
year of account of the licensee, and from such date the licensee shall, except 
where prevented by causes beyond his control, be under obligation—
 



       (a)  subject to such directions as the Board may from time to time give 
him, to keep the station at all times in good and substantial repair and 
condition and ready for use, together with adequate staff for operating, 
maintaining and controlling the station, and not to make any substantial 
alterations or renewals in, or remove any essential or substantial part of, the 
station without the consent in writing of the Board;
 



       (b)  to operate the station so as to generate such quantity of 
electricity with such units of plant at such rates of output and at such times, 
or to cease to generate electricity during such periods, as the Board may 
direct;
 



       (c)  to carry out as soon as may be practicable such reasonable 
extensions, alterations or renewals of the station or any part thereof as the 
Board may from time to time direct;
 



       (d)  to supply to the Board all the electricity generated at the station.
 


(2) 
To enable a licensee to comply with any direction under sub-paragraph (1) 
requiring extension of the station or any part thereof for purposes of the 
Board, the Board may, if it considers it expedient and practicable so to do, 
offer to advance to him a loan upon such terms and conditions as it may deem 
proper and the licensee 

1[may 
accept the loan from the Board on the terms and conditions offered or may raise 
a loan from other sources or employ his own funds for the purpose of such 
extension]:
 



Provided that notwithstanding anything contained in any law or in any mortgage, 
charge or instrument executed by the licensee, the loan so advanced by the Board 
and the interest thereon shall be a first charge on the extension and subject to 
any prior encumbrance shall also be charged on the undertaking and all the 
revenues of the licensee and no such loan shall be amortized in any way by the 
licensee:
 



Provided further that if at the date of purchase of the station under this Act 
or of the licensee’s undertaking under the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 (9 of 
1910), the said principal or any part thereof remains unpaid though due for 
redemption or is not on that date due for redemption, then any sum payable by 
the purchaser as a percentage on account of compulsory purchase under this Act 
or the said Act shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same proportion to 
that sum as the amount of the said principal or part thereof remaining unpaid or 
not being due for redemption as aforesaid bears to the total of the ordinary, 
preference and debenture capital of the licensee and the loans advanced by the 
Board under this sub-paragraph.
 



Explanation.—In 
the sub-paragraph, the expressions “ordinary capital”, “preference capital” and 
“debenture capital” have the meanings respectively assigned to them in the Sixth 
Schedule.
 



II. 
From the date of control the Board shall, except where prevented by causes 
beyond its control, be under obligation to supply to the licensee, and the 
licensee shall be under obligation to take from the Board, the whole of the 
electricity required by the licensee for the purposes of his undertaking except 
such quantity of electricity as the licensee may from the time being be entitled 
under paragraph III to purchase from a source other than the Board or as he may 
be generating in another station, not being a controlled station.
 



III. 
Unless otherwise agreed between the Board and the licensee, the licensee shall 
not, where he has received a notice under paragraph I, purchase after the date 
of control any quantity of electricity from a source other than the Board:
 



Provided that where on the date of the receipt of such notice the licensee is 
bound under any contract to purchase any quantity of electricity from some other 
source, he may, for a period not exceeding two years after the date of control 
or for such further period, if any, as the Board may allow, continue to purchase 
electricity under the said contract from such other source.
 



IV. 
The Board shall pay to the licensee, whether or not any electricity is generated 
at the station, the costs ascertained in accordance with the provisions of the 
Eighth Schedule.
 



V. 
The price to be paid by the licensee for electricity supplied by the Board shall 
be determined in the manner provided in the appropriate Part of this Schedule.
 



VI. 
The points at which electricity to be supplied under this Schedule shall be 
delivered by the Board and the licensee respectively shall, unless otherwise 
agreed between the Board and the licensee, be at the generating station, and the 
pressure of the supplies shall be such as the Board and the licensee may agree.
 



VII. 
Where any licensee owns more than one controlled station—
 



       (a)  such of the several controlled stations as are inter-connected 
shall, for the purposes of this Schedule, be deemed to comprise a single 
controlled station, and, unless the subject or context otherwise requires, the 
provisions of this Schedule shall be construed as if the word “combined” had 
been inserted before the word “station” or the words “generating station” 
wherever they occur;
 



       (b)  the electricity supplied at the several controlled stations by the 
licensee to the Board, or by the Board to the licensee, shall each respectively 
be treated as single supplies;
 



       (c)  in the application of clause (a) of paragraph XII, the costs of 
production at each of the several controlled stations shall be separately 
ascertained, and in the application of clause (c) of the said paragraph—
 


   
(i)  the sums ascertained in accordance with clause (a) of paragraph I of the 
Eighth Schedule in respect of each of the several controlled stations shall be 
separately allocated between fixed costs and running costs, and
 


  
(ii)  the sum of the several fixed costs and the sum of the several running 
costs shall be the fixed costs and the running costs respectively of the 
combined station;
 



       (d)  in directing the operation of the combined station under clause (b) 
of sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph I the Board shall have regard to the nature 
and capacity of the licensee’s transmission system inter-connecting the several 
controlled stations and to the requirements of the licensee at each of those 
stations.
 



VIII. 
In the event of the licensee failing, except where prevented by causes beyond 
his control, to perform or continue to perform any obligation imposed upon him 
under this Part, the Board may give notice to him in writing that on the first 
day of the licensee’s next succeeding year of account the generating station 
will be purchased by the Board, and on such day the Board shall purchase the 
station at a price determined in accordance with the Fourth Schedule, and 
thereafter—
 



       (a)  all the provisions of this Schedule except paragraph II and this 
paragraph shall, in relation to the licensee, cease to have effect;
 



       (b)  the Board shall supply the licensee with the electricity required by 
him under paragraph II at such price and on such conditions as the Board may 
determine.
 




Part II
 



Price to be paid for electricity supplied by the Board under Part I
 



IX. 

There shall be agreed between the Board and the licensee in respect of each 
month of the licensee’s year of account—
 



       (a)  the maximum capacity of the station, that is to say, the maximum 
capacity (expressed in kilowatts available for supply to feeders) of such plant 
and works appertaining to the generation of electricity at the station as were 
available for reliable and regular commercial operation on the first day of the 
month, including the capacity of such plant and works as were temporarily out of 
commission;
 



       (b)  the number and size of units of plant and works, forming part of the 
aforesaid plant and works, which ought properly to be deemed to be standby if 
the station were not a controlled station;
 



       (c)  the standby capacity of the station, that is to say, the number of 
kilowatts (expressed in kilowatts available for supply to feeders) by which the 
maximum capacity of the station would be reduced if the standby plant and works 
referred to in clause (b) were to be left out of account;
 



       (d)  the actual effective capacity of the station, that is to say, the 
number of kilowatts by which the maximum capacity exceeds the standby capacity.
 



X. 
(1) 
The licensee shall be entitled to purchase from the station in each month at a 
price determined under paragraph XIII a number of kilowatts not exceeding the 
scheduled effective capacity of the station on the first day of that month as 
determined in sub-paragraph (2).
 


(2) 
The scheduled effective capacity of the station shall be agreed between the 
Board and the licensee in respect of each month of the year of account, and 
shall be computed in the same manner as the actual effective capacity under 
paragraph IX, except that there shall be left out of account such units of plant 
and works, if any, forming part of the plant and works referred to in clause (a) 
of the said paragraph, as the licensee declares to be surplus to his 
requirements for the time being:
 



Provided that the licensee shall not declare to be surplus to his requirements 
any such units of plant and works as were installed or were on order at the date 
of control or which were included in any previous computation of the scheduled 
effective capacity:
 



Provided further that if as a result of the licensee declaring as surplus to his 
requirements any units of plants or works, the scheduled effective capacity is 
in respect of any month computed to be less than the maximum demand of the 
licensee on the station for the purposes of his own undertaking, then such units 
of plant or works and all further additional units of plant or works shall 
thereafter always be deemed to be surplus to the requirements of the licensee as 
aforesaid unless the Board decides otherwise.
 



XI. 
Of the kilowatt-hours purchased by the licensee from the Board in each month, a 
number kilowatt-hours not exceeding the number which bears the same proportion 
to the total number purchased as the scheduled effective capacity for the month 
bears to the maximum demand of the licensee on the Board in that month shall be 
purchased at a price determined under paragraph XIII; the balance being 
purchased at a price determined under paragraph XIV:
 



Provided that if the station is a hydro-electric station or if any unit of a 
combined station is a hydro-electric unit, the number of kilowatt-hours which 
the licensee shall be entitled to purchase as aforesaid shall be reduced by such 
amount, if any, as may be agreed between the Board and the licensee, having 
regard to the number of kilowatt-hours actually supplied in the month from such 
hydro-electric station or unit.
 



XII. 
As soon as practicable after the end of a year of account—
 



       (a)  there shall be ascertained in respect of that year the cost of 
production at the station in accordance with the provisions of the Eighth 
Schedule;
 



       (b) there shall be deducted from the total sum ascertained in respect of 
that year under clauses (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of paragraph I of the Eighth 
Schedule, such proportion of the charges referred to in the said clauses as are 
wholly attributable to so much of the plant and works, if any, as has been 
declared by the licensee under sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph X to be surplus to 
his requirements, and the balance remaining after such deduction shall for the 
purposes of this Schedule be referred to as the scheduled overhead charges:
 



                Provided that in assessing the said proportion regard shall be 
had to the period during which any such plant or works were declared to be 
surplus as aforesaid;
 



       (c) there shall be allocated between fixed costs and running costs in 
accordance with the provisions of the Ninth Schedule the sum ascertained in 
respect of that year under clause (a) of paragraph I of the Eighth Schedule, and 
the amount of running costs divided by the number of kilowatt-hours supplied 
from the station in that year shall for the purposes of this Schedule be 
referred to as the running charges component;
 



       (d)  there shall be ascertained in respect of that year an amount (in 
this Schedule referred to as the scheduled fixed works costs) calculated from 
the expression
 



             “A              A               B
 



            ——      +   ——    x      —— Where—
 



              2               2              C”
 



          A=the amount of fixed costs ascertained in respect of that year under 
clause (c);
 



          B=the sum of the scheduled effective capacities for each month of that 
year;
 



          C=the sum of the actual effective capacities for each month of that 
year.
 



XIII. 
The licensee shall pay to the Board in respect of each month of the year of 
account for the electricity purchased under paragraphs X and XI—
 



       (a) in respect of kilowatts, an amount equal to one-twelfth of the sum of 
the scheduled overhead charges and the scheduled fixed works costs;
 



       (b)  in respect of kilowatt-hours a sum found by multiplying the number 
of kilowatt-hours supplied by the running charges component:
 



Provided that if in any year of account the station for any reason ceases to 
generate electricity for one thousand hours or more, then for the purposes of 
ascertaining the running charges component and the scheduled fixed works costs 
under clauses (c) and (d) respectively of paragraph XII—
 



        (i)  the said clause (c) shall be construed as if there were substituted 
for the words “that year” in both places where they occur, the words “the most 
recent year of account in which the station did not cease to generate 
electricity for one thousand hours or more” and as if to the said clause the 
following proviso were added, namely:—
 



                 “Provided that so much of the said sum as is represented by the 
cost of fuel shall be adjusted to take account of the cost which would have been 
incurred had that fuel been consumed at the average prices prevailing in the 
actual year of account.”;
 



       (ii) in evaluating the expression contained in the said clause (d), the 
letter C shall be deemed to be equal to the sum of the actual effective 
capacities for each month of the most recent year of account in which the 
station did not cease to generate electricity for one thousand hours or more:
 



Provided further that if in any year of account there exist in the station any 
units of plant or works which have been declared by the licensee under 
sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph X to be surplus to his requirements in that year, 
there shall be added to the running charges component in respect of that year 
the amount, if any, by which that part of the said component attributable to the 
cost of fuel is less than ninety per centum of the corresponding part of 
the running charges component in respect of the year of account immediately 
preceding that in which the earliest installed of the said units of plant or 
works first came into commercial operation in the station, and in ascertaining 
the corresponding part as aforesaid, the fuel consumed shall be deemed to be of 
the same average quality and to be consumed at the same average cost per ton as 
the fuel consumed in the year of account:
 



Provided further that if in respect of any month of the year of account any 
units of plant or works previously declared by the licensee as aforesaid to be 
surplus to his requirements are for the first time take into account in 
assessing the scheduled effective capacity for that month, then in addition to 
the payment referred to in clause (a) the licensee shall pay to the Board a sum 
equal to any sums previously paid by the Board to the licensee on revenue 
account (in respect of any period prior to the date on which the said units of 
plant or works came into commission) by way of interest, depreciation, testing 
and turning-up expenses attributable to the said units of plant or works; and 
the sum to be paid as aforesaid shall become due in one or more instalments and 
at such time or times as the Board may direct.
 



XIV. 
The price payable by the licensee to the Board for all electricity supplied by 
the Board to him in excess of the quantities referred to in paragraphs X and XI 
shall be the Grid Tariff.
 



XV. 
The licensee shall have the right at any time, on giving to the Board prior 
notice in writing expiring at the end of any year of account, to purchase from 
the Board at the Grid Tariff the whole of the electricity supplied to him by the 
Board thereafter:
 



Provided that the Board in those circumstances may make it a condition that the 
licensee shall, until the date on which the scheduled effective capacity of the 
station becomes nil, pay to the Board in respect of each month in addition to 
the Grid Tariff one-twelfth of such proportion as the Board may fix of the 
annual charges by way of interest and depreciation which would have been payable 
to the Board in respect of the year of account had the said notice not been 
given:
 



Provided further that in assessing the scheduled effective capacity for the 
purposes of the first proviso all units of plant or works which may have been 
under this Schedule declared or deemed to be surplus to the requirements of the 
licensee at the date of the expiration of the said notice and all additional 
units of plant or works shall after that date always be deemed to be surplus to 
the requirements of the licensee:
 



Provided further that after the expiration of the said notice the licensee shall 
not be entitled any time to purchase electricity from the Board at the price 
ascertained under paragraph XIII.
 




PART III
 



Permanent closing down of a controlled station
 



XVI. 
The Board may give the licensee not less than six months’ notice in writing 
expiring at the end of any year of account that from the first day of next 
succeeding year of account it will not again direct the licensee to generate any 
electricity in the station, and upon that date (hereinafter in this Schedule 
referred to as the date of closing down) the station shall be permanently closed 
down.
 



XVII. 
From the date of closing down paragraphs I, IV and VIII shall, in relation to 
the stations, cease to have effect, and on receipt of the notice under paragraph 
XVI the licensee shall have the option (to be exercised by a date not later than 
three months prior to the date of closing down) either—
 



       (a)  (i) to sell the station at any time after the date of closing down, 
and
 



             (ii) to purchase the electricity supplied to him by the Board at 
the Grid Tariff, or
 



       (b) (i) to require the Board to purchase the station or at the option of 
the licensee the undertaking of the licensee at the date of closing down at a 
price determined under the Fourth Schedule, and
 



             (ii) to purchase the electricity supplied to him by the Board in 
accordance with the provisions of Part II as modified by paragraph XVIII:
 



Provided that where the station cannot be severed from the distributing system 
of the licensee or where the severance of the station from the distributing 
system of the licensee is likely to affect prejudicially the interests of the 
licensee, the licensee shall be entitled to demand that the Board shall purchase 
his entire undertaking and on such demand being made the Board shall purchase 
the entire undertaking of the licensee.
 


Any 
question arising under the proviso to this paragraph shall be referred to 
arbitration under section 76.
 



XVIII. 
Where licensee exercises his option under paragraph XVII in terms of clause (b) 
thereof, the Board shall comply with the requirement to purchase the station 
under sub-clause (i) of that clause, and in applying the provisions of Part II 
to the purchase by the licensee of electricity supplied to him by the Board,—
 



       (a)  the station shall, notwithstanding that it has been permanently 
closed down, be deemed to remain a controlled station in operation but to be 
such a station which has ceased to generate electricity for one thousand hours 
or more during each year of account;
 



       (b)  clause (a) of paragraph IX shall be construed as if the following 
were substituted therefor, namely:—
 



                    “(a) the maximum capacity of the station, that is to say, 
the maximum capacity (expressed in kilowatts available for supply to feeders) of 
such plant and works appertaining to the generation of electricity at the date 
of closing down as would have been available for reliable and regular commercial 
operation on the first day of each month had the station not been closed down 
under Part III and had no replacement of any major item of such plant or works 
been carried out;”;
 



       (c)  clause (a) of paragraph XII shall be construed as if the following 
were substituted therefor, namely:—
 



                    “(a) there shall be ascertained in respect of the year of 
account such annual charges by way of interest and depreciation attributable to 
the assets purchased by the Board under Part III as would have resulted from the 
application of clauses (e) and (f) of paragraph I of the Eighth Schedule and had 
those assets remained in the ownership of the licensee;”;
 



       (d) clause (b) of paragraph XII shall be construed as if the reference 
therein to clauses (b), (c) and (d) of paragraph I of the Eighth Schedule were 
omitted;
 



       (e) there shall be added to the sum payable by the licensee to the Board 
under clause (a) of paragraph XIII in each month of the year of account a sum 
equal to one-twelfth of the amount calculated from the expression,
 



        “A x B
 



        ————  Where—
 



            C”
 



          A=that part of the scheduled overhead charges payable by the licensee 
to the Board in respect of the most recent year of account during which the 
station did not cease to generate electricity for one thousand hours or more, 
which relates to the items referred to in clauses (b), (c) and (d) of paragraph 
I of the Eighth Schedule;
 



          B=the sum of the scheduled effective capacities for each month of the 
year of account;
 



          C=the sum of the scheduled effective capacities for each month of the 
most recent year of account as aforesaid.
 




PART IV
 



Purchase by Board of controlled station not to be closed down
 



XIX. 
Where in respect of any month notified by the Board (and hereinafter in this 
Schedule referred to as the relevant month), the scheduled effective capacity of 
the station is computed under paragraph X to be less than one-half of the actual 
effective capacity of the station, the Board may give to the licensee six 
month’s notice in writing that on the first day of the year of account next 
following the date of expiration of such notice the station will be purchased by 
the Board.
 



XX. 
Notwithstanding anything contained in paragraph X, in computing the scheduled 
effective capacity for purposes of paragraph XIX there shall be left out of 
account all such units of plant and works as would not reasonably have been 
required by the licensee for purposes other than supply to the Board had the 
station not been a controlled station.
 



XXI. 
Where a notice under paragraph XIX has been served by the Board on the licensee, 
the Board shall purchase the station or where a severance of the station from 
the distributing system of the licensee is not possible or is likely to affect 
prejudicially the interest of the licensee and the licensee so requires the 
entire undertaking of the licensee at the date specified in the notice and at a 
price determined under the Fourth Schedule.
 



XXII. 
From the date of purchase of the station or at the option of the licensee the 
undertaking of the licensee under paragraph XXI the provisions of paragraphs I,

licensee shall be required to purchase the electricity supplied to him by the 
Board in accordance with the provisions of Part II as modified by paragraph 
XXIII.
 



XXIII. 
In applying the provisions of Part II to the purchase by a licensee whose 
station has been purchased under this Part of electricity supplied to him by the 
Board,—
 



       (a)  the station shall, notwithstanding that it has been purchased by the 
Board, be deemed to remain a controlled station;
 



       (b)  clause (a) of paragraph XII shall be construed as if the reference 
therein to the provisions of the Eighth Schedule excluded a reference to clauses 
(b), (c) and (d) of paragraph I of that Schedule, and as if the following 
proviso were added to the said clause (a), namely:—
 



                    “Provided that the annual charges to be included in 
accordance with clauses (e) and (f) of paragraph I of the said Schedule shall be 
such as would have resulted had the assets purchased by the Board under Part IV 
remained in the ownership of the licensee”;
 



       (c)  clause (b) of paragraph XII shall be construed as if the reference 
therein to clauses (b), (c) and (d) of paragraph I of the Eighth Schedule were 
omitted;
 



       (d) there shall be added to the sum payable by the licensee to the Board 
under clause (a) of paragraph XIII in each month of the year of account a sum 
equal to one twelfth of the amount calculated from the expression,

Closing Down of Generating Stations Other Than  

Controlled Stations
 



I. 
Where the Board proposes under section 36 permanently to close down a generating 
station other than a controlled station, it shall give the licensee owning the 
station not less than six months, notice in writing expiring at the end of any 
year of account that from the first day of the next succeeding year of account 
(hereafter in this Schedule referred to as the date of closing down) the station 
shall be permanently closed down.
 



II. 
From the date of closing down the Board shall be under obligation to supply to 
the licensee, except where prevented by causes beyond its control, and the 
licensee shall be under obligation to take from the Board, the whole of the 
electricity required by the licensee for the purposes of his undertaking, except 
such quantity of electricity as the licensee may for the time being be entitled 
under paragraph III to purchase from a source other than the Board or as he may 
be generating in another station, not being a controlled station.
 



III. 
Unless otherwise agreed between the Board and the licensee, the licensee shall 
not, where he has received a notice under paragraph I, purchase after the date 
of closing down any quantity of electricity from a source other than the Board:
 



Provided that where on the date of the receipt of such notice the licensee is 
bound under any contract to purchase any quantity of electricity from some other 
source, he may, for a period not exceeding two years after the date of closing 
down or for such further period, if any, as the Board may allow, continue to 
purchase electricity under the said contract from such other source.
 



IV. 
(1) The point at which electricity to be supplied by the Board shall be 
delivered to the licensee shall, unless otherwise agreed between the Board and 
the licensee, be at the licensee’s generating station, and the pressure of 
supply shall be such as may be agreed between the Board and the licensee.
 


(2) 
The Board shall bear the whole of the cost of the service apparatus required for 
making the supply available to the licensee.
 



V. 
The licensee shall have the option, to be exercised by a date not later than 
three months prior to the date of closing down, either—
 



       (a)  (i) to sell the station at any time after the date of closing down, 
and
 



             (ii) to purchase the whole of the electricity supplied to him by 
the Board at the Grid Tariff, or
 



       (b) (i) to require the Board to purchase the station 

1[or 
the entire undertaking] at the date of closing down at a price determined under 
the Fourth Schedule, and
 



             (ii) to purchase the whole of the electricity supplied to him by 
the Board on the terms hereafter set out in this Schedule.
 



VI. 
Where a licensee exercises his option under paragraph V in terms of clause (b) 
thereof, the Board shall comply with the requirement to purchase under 
sub-clause (i) of that clause, and the following provisions of this Schedule 
shall apply.
 



VII. 
As soon as practicable after the licensee has exercised his option as aforesaid, 
there shall be ascertained and agreed between him and the Board the following 
quantities in respect of each year of account subsequent to the date of closing 
down, namely:—
 



       (a)  The maximum capacity of the station, that is to say, the maximum 
capacity (expressed in kilowatts available for supply to feeders) of such plant 
and works appertaining to the generation of electricity at the date of closing 
down as would have been available for reliable and regular commercial operation 
on the first day of the year of account, had the station not been closed down 
under this Schedule and had no replacement of any major item of such plant or 
works been carried out subsequent to the date of closing down.
 



       (b)  The number and size of units of plant and works, forming part of the 
aforesaid plant and works, which would have represented reasonable standby in 
the station.
 



       (c)  The standby capacity of the station, that is to say, the number of 
kilowatts (expressed in kilowatts available for supply to feeders) by which the 
maximum capacity of the station would be reduced if the standby plant and works 
referred to in clause (b) were to be left out of account.
 



       (d)  The agreed effective capacity of the station, that is to say, the 
number of kilowatts by which the maximum capacity exceeds the standby capacity.
 



VIII. 
As soon as practicable after the date of closing down there shall be ascertained 
in agreement between the Board and the licensee in respect of each of the three 
consecutive years of account immediately preceding the date of closing down 
(hereafter in this Schedule referred to as the basic years)—
 



       (a) the sums expended by the licensee and wholly attributable to the 
generation of electricity under the following heads, namely:—
 



             (i)  fuel;
 



            (ii)  less oil, water and stores consumed;

           (vi)  any other expense on revenue account;
 



       (b)  the actual effective capacity of the station on the first day of 
each such year agreed in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph IX 
of the First Schedule.
 



IX. 
As soon as practicable after the beginning of each year of account there shall 
be ascertained in respect of that year such annual charges by way of interest 
and depreciation attributable to the assets purchased by the Board under this 
Schedule as would have resulted from the application of clauses (e) and (f) of 
paragraph I of the Eighth Schedule, had those assets remained in the ownership 
of the licensee.
 



X. 
The licensee shall be entitled to purchase from the Board in each year of 
account at a price determined under paragraph XI—

ascertained in respect of that year under paragraph VII, and
 



       (b) a number of kilowatt-hours not exceeding the number of kilowatt-hours 
which bears the same proportion to the total number of kilowatt-hours required 
by the licensee in that year for the purposes of his undertaking as the agreed 
effective capacity ascertained in respect of that year bears to the total 
maximum demand of the licensee in that year for the said purposes.
 



XI. 
The price payable by the licensee in respect of each year of account for the 
quantity of electricity specified in paragraph X shall be—
 



       (a)  in respect of kilowatts, a fixed charge equal to the sum of—
 


   
(i)  an amount calculated from the expression,
 



                  “A              A                 B
 



                 ——      +   ——      x      ——;
 



                  2               2                C”
 


  
(ii) an amount calculated from the expression
 



        “B x D
 



         ———;
 



           C”
 



(iii) the annual charges by way of interest and depreciation ascertained in 
respect of the year of account under paragraph IX, where—
 



        A=one-third of the total costs during the basic years under heads (ii), 
(iii), (iv) and (vi) set out in clause (a) of paragraph VIII;
 



        B=the agreed effective capacity for the year of account;
 



        C=one-third of the sum of the actual effective capacities [ascertained 
under clause (b) of paragraph VIII] for each of the basic years;
 



        D=one-third of the total costs during the basic year under head (v) set 
out in clause (a) of paragraph VIII;
 



       (b) in respect of kilowatt-hours, a running charge per kilowatt-hour 
ascertained—
 


    (i) by multiplying the 
total number of tons of fuel consumed in the station in the basic years by the 
estimate agreed between the Board and the licensee of the cost per ton which 
would have been incurred in delivering the handling the same quantity of fuel of 
equivalent calorific value to the furnaces in the station during the year of 
account, had the station remained in the ownership of the licensee, and
 


  
(ii)  by dividing the total cost so found by the total number of units sent out 
from the station in the basic years.
 



XII. 
The price payable by the licensee for all electricity supplied to him by the 
Board in excess of the quantity specified in paragraph X shall be the Grid 
Tariff.
 



XIII. 
The licensee shall have the right at any time on giving the Board prior notice 
in writing expiring at the end of a year of account of purchase at the Grid 
Tariff the whole of the electricity supplied to him by the Board:
 



Provided that the Board in those circumstances may make it a condition that the 
licensee shall, until the date on which the agreed effective capacity of the 
station becomes nil, pay to the Board in each year of account in addition to the 
Grid Tariff a sum equal to such proportion as the Board may fix of the annual 
charges by way of interest and depreciation ascertained in respect of the year 
under paragraph IX:
 



Provided further that after the expiration of the said notice, the licensee 
shall not be entitled at any time to purchase electricity from the Board at the 
price ascertained under paragraph XI.

Financial Principles And Their Application
 



I.


2[Notwithstanding 
anything contained in the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 (9 of 1910) 

3[[except 
sub-section (2) of section 22A]], and the provisions in the licence of a 
licensee, the licensee shall so adjust his 

4[charges] 
for the sale of electricity whether by enhancing or reducing them that his clear 
profit in any year of account shall not, as far as possible, exceed the amount 
of reasonable return:]
 



5[Provided 
that such 

6[charges] 
shall not be enhanced more than once in any year of account:
 



Provided further that the licensee shall not be deemed to have failed so to 
adjust his 

4[charges] 
if the clear profit in any year of account has not exceeded the amount of 
reasonable return by 

6[twenty]
per centum of the amount of reasonable return:
 



Provided further that the licensee shall not enhance the 

7[charges] 
for the supply of electricity until after the expiry of a notice in writing of 
not less than sixty clear days of his intention to so enhance the 

7[charges], 
given by him to the State Government and to the Board:
 



Provided further that if the 

7[charges] 
of supply fixed in pursuance of the recommendations of a rating committee 
constituted under section 57A are lower than those notified by the licensee 
under and in accordance with the preceding proviso, the licensee shall refund to 
the consumers the excess amount recovered by him for them:]
 



8[Provided 
also that nothing in this Schedule shall be deemed to prevent a licensee from 
levying with the previous approval of the State Government, minimum charges for 
supply of electricity for any purpose.]
 



8[IA. 
The notice referred to in the third proviso to paragraph I shall be accompanied 
by such financial and technical data in support of the proposed enhancement of 
charges as the State Government may, by general or special order, specify.]
 



II. 
(1) If the clear profit of a licensee in any year of account is in excess of the 
amount of reasonable return, one-third of such excess, not exceeding 

9[five 
per cent.] of the amount of reasonable return, shall be at the disposal of the 
undertaking. Of the balance of the excess, one-half shall be appropriated to a 
reserve which shall be called the Tariffs and Dividends Control Reserve and the 
remaining half shall either be distributed in the form of a proportional rebate 
on the amounts collected from the sale of electricity and meter rentals or 
carried forward in the accounts of the licensee for distribution to the 
consumers in future, in such manner as the State Government may direct.
 


(2) 
The Tariffs and Dividends Control Reserve shall be available for disposal by the 
licensee only to the extent by which the clear profit is less than the 
reasonable return in any year of account.
 


(3) 
On the purchase of the undertaking under the terms of its licence any balance 
remaining in the Tariffs and Dividends Control Reserve shall be handed over to 
the purchaser and maintained as such Tariffs and Dividends Control Reserve:
 



10[Provided 
that where the undertaking is purchased by the Board or the State Government, 
the amount of the Reserve may be deducted from the price payable to the 
licensee.]
 



11[(4) 
On the purchase of the undertaking after the expiry, or on the revocation, of 
its licence or otherwise, all amounts of rebate lying undistributed to the 
consumers on the date of such purchase, shall be handed over to the purchaser 
who, in turn, shall enter the same in his books of account, under the heading 
Consumers’ Rebate Reserve and any amount lying undistributed in that Reserve 
shall be carried forward for distribution to the consumer concerned:
 



Provided that the share of money in the Consumers’ Rebate Reserve payable to the 
consumers who are not traceable or who have ceased to be consumers in relation 
to that undertaking, may be utilised in the development works of the purchaser.]
 



III. 
There shall be created from existing reserves or from the revenues of the 
undertaking a reserve to be called “Contingencies Reserve”.
 



IV. 
(1) The licensee shall appropriate to Contingencies Reserve from the revenues of 
each year of account a sum not less than one-quarter of one per centum 
and not more than one-half of one per centum to the original cost of 
fixed assets, provided that if the said reserve exceeds, or would by such 
appropriation, be caused to exceed, five per centum of the original cost 
of fixed assets, no appropriation shall be made which would have the effect of 
increasing the reserve beyond the said maximum.
 



12[(2) 
The sums appropriated to the Contingencies Reserve shall be invested in 
securities authorised under the Indian Trusts Act, 1882 (2 of 1882) and such 
investment shall be made within a period of six months of the close of the year 
of account in which such appropriation is made.]
 



V.


13[(1)] 
The Contingencies Reserve shall not be drawn upon during the currency of the 
licence except to meet such charges as the State Government may approve as 
being—
 



       (a)  expenses or loss of profits arising out of accidents, strikes or 
circumstances which the management could not have prevented;
 



       (b)  expenses on replacement or removal of plant or works other than 
expenses requisite for normal maintenance or renewal;
 



       (c)  compensation payable under any law for the time being in force and 
for which no other provision is made.
 



14[(2) 
On the purchase of the undertaking, the Contingencies Reserve, after deduction 
of the amounts drawn under sub-paragraph (1), shall be handed over to the 
purchaser and maintained as such Contingencies Reserve:
 



Provided that where the undertaking is purchased by the Board or the State 
Government, the amount of the Reserve computed as above shall, after further 
deduction of the amount of compensation, if any, payable to the employees of the 
outgoing licensee under any law for the time being in force, be handed over to 
the Board or the State Government, as the case may be.]
 



15[VA. 
(1) There shall be created a reserve to be called the Development Reserve to 
which shall be appropriated in respect of each accounting year a sum equal to 
the amount of income-tax and super-tax calculated at rates applicable during the 
assessment year for which the accounting year of the licensee is the previous 
year, on the 

16[amount 
of investment allowance] to which the licensee is entitled for the accounting 
year 

17[under 
section 32A of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (43 of 1961)]:
 



Provided that if in any accounting year, the clear profit [excluding the special 
appropriation to be made under item (va) of clause (c) of sub-paragraph (2) of 
paragraph XVII] together with the accumulations, if any, in the Tariffs and 
Dividends Control Reserve less the sum calculated as aforesaid falls short of 
the reasonable return, the sum to be appropriated to the Development Reserve in 
respect of such account year shall be reduced by the amount of the shortfall.
 


(2) 
Any sum to be appropriated towards the Development Reserve in respect of any 
accounting year under sub-paragraph (1), may be appropriated in annual 
instalments spread over a period not exceeding five years from the commencement 
of that accounting year.
 


(3) 
The Development Reserve shall be available only for investment in the business 
of electricity supply of the undertaking.
 


(4) 
On the purchase of the undertaking, the Development Reserve shall be handed over 
to the purchaser and maintained as such Development Reserve:]
 



18[Provided 
that where the undertaking is purchased by the Board or the State Government, 
the amount of the Reserve 

19[(whether 
such amount is in the form of cash or other assets)] may be deducted from the 
price payable to the licensee.]
 



20[VI.
(a) The licensee shall provide each year for depreciation such sum 
calculated in accordance with such principles as the Central Government may, 
after consultation with the Authority, by notification in the Official Gazette, 
lay down from time to time.
 


(b) 
Where in any particular year depreciation cannot be adjusted against revenues, 
the same may be carried over to subsequent years.
 


(c) 
The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to the charging of depreciation for 
the year in which the Electricity (Supply) Amendment Act, 1978 (23 of 1978), 
comes into force.]
 



XII. 
Where contributions are made by consumers towards the cost of construction of 
service lines constructed after the date on which this Act comes into force only 
the net cost of such service lines after deducting such contributions shall be 
included in the cost of fixed assets for the purposes of arriving at the capital 
base:
 



Provided that for the purposes of depreciation under paragraph VI, the total 
original cost of construction of the service lines shall be taken into account.
 



XIII. 
(1) Subject to the provisions of sub-paragraph (2) the ordinary remuneration of 
a managing agent excluding the office allowance mentioned in sub-paragraph (3) 
but including purchasing commission, if any, shall be based on a percentage of

21[as 
determined in accordance with the provisions of section 349 of the Companies 
Act, 1956 (1 of 1956)], and shall not exceed—
 



       (a)  in respect of the first Rs. 5 lakh of such net profits—10 per cent.; 
and
 



       (b)  in respect of all net profits in excess of Rs. 5 lakh—7 per cent.
 


(2) 
The amount paid to a managing agent shall be subject to a minimum payment on 
account of ordinary remuneration not exceeding two rupees per annum for each 
complete thousand rupees of paid up share and debenture capital, provide that 
for purposes of computing the minimum payment should the share and debenture 
capital be less than rupees five lakh it shall be taken as rupees five lakh and 
should the said capital be greater than rupees one crore it shall be taken as 
rupees one crore.
 


(3) 
An office allowance drawn by a managing agent which shall include the salaries 
and wages of all persons employed in the office of the managing agent, but not 
the salaries of the engineering staff employed for purposes of the undertaking, 
shall be a percentage of the operating expenditure and the expenditure during 
the year of account on capital works. The office allowance so drawn shall not 
exceed—
 



       (a)  In respect of the first Rs. 1 lakh of operating expenditure—8 per 
cent.
 



             In respect of the next Rs. 2 lakh of operating expenditure—5 per 
cent.
 



             In respect of the next Rs. 7 lakh of operating expenditure—2.5 per

where no Board is constituted, the State Government for its concurrence.
 


(2)
