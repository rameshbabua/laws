    Explanation.—In 
    this sub-section, the expression “person interested” means the person who 
    was in actual possession of the premises requisitioned under section 65 
    immediately before the requisition, or where no person was in such actual 
    possession, the owner of such premises.

    Whenever any Committee, Authority or officer, referred to in sub-section (1) 
    of section 65 in pursuance of that section requisitions any vehicle, there 
    shall be paid to the owner thereof compensation the amount of which shall be 
    determined by the Central Government or the State Government, as the case 
    may be, on the basis of the fares or rates prevailing in the locality for 
    the hire of such vehicle:
 
Provided 
    that where the owner of such vehicle being aggrieved by the amount of 
    compensation so determined makes an application within the prescribed time 
    to the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be, for 
    referring the matter to an arbitrator, the amount of compensation to be paid 
    shall be such as the arbitrator appointed in this behalf by the Central 
    Government or the State Government, as the case may be, may determine:
 
Provided 
    further that where immediately before the requisitioning the vehicle or 
    vessel was by virtue of a hire purchase agreement in the possession of a 
    person other than the owner, the amount determined under this sub-section as 
    the total compensation payable in respect of the requisition shall be 
    apportioned between that person and the owner in such manner as they may 
    agree upon, and in default of agreement, in such manner as an arbitrator 
    appointed by the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may 
    be, in this behalf may decide.
